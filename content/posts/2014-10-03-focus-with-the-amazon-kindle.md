I've been writing about [focusing on what matters](/life-is-art/ "Life is Art") lately by [making good choices](/achievable-contentment/) with how and what you consume. Some things are just a complete waste of time like the [local news](/rubbernecking-with-the-locals/). Other things have a good alternative, like [reading the Economist](/the-economist-keeps-it-real/) instead of going to [news sites](/escaping-with-the-news/).

As I wrote last time, though, in this mobile world that isn't enough. You have to make sure your smartphone is serving you and not enslaving you. And beyond that I'm convinced **to lead a life of growth and meaning you need to read.** Probably more than you are right now.

So how do we do that? The solutions that come to mind immediately are: on our smartphone, a paper book, or a tablet. I'm going to talk about a better way to read books: through the Amazon Kindle.

A few years back [my friend Chris](http://www.chrisdikes.com/) asked me what I thought about the Kindle, and my opinion to him as of July 16, 2010 was: "_It seems like having a book would be better._" Well, thankfully Chris didn't listen to my awful advice and bought one, told me about it, changed my mind, and I haven't looked back.

Here's what's so great about the Kindle:

  1. **Distractionless:** yes, that's a feature and not a bug. I like it that there aren't pop ups telling me all about the emails I'm not reading or the cool Facebook posts that I need to be looking into. I'm here to read. The Kindle helps me read.
  2. **Battery Life:** I don't have to be preoccupied with powering the stupid thing while I'm using it. I can read. I have to charge it every once and a while. It's not like the power sucking smartphone or tablet.
  3. **Position Independent:** this may seem small to some, but I like reading while I'm laying down. And I get comfortable holding a book in one hand. Then I read fast and get to the other side of the book. So I have to move to read the other section. It seems like a small thing, and admittedly a first-world problem, but I love how I can read the Kindle with one hand laying on the same side for as long as it is comfortable.
  4. **Sleep Friendly Lighting:** I have the Kindle paperwhite that doesn't blast light into my eyes and keep me up. I can do a little nighttime reading with a very small amount of light. It also doesn't distract my wife.
  5. **Borrower Capable:** I have learned to take advantage of my library's borrower privileges on the Kindle. This is easy once you figure it out. I do admit to buying more books than I would have before, but I think that's a good thing as long as I read them.
  6. **Keeps Your Place:** I pick up the book and read exactly where I left off. I don't have to think about it. I just go.
  7. **Read More:** I've read much more than before. If I'm interested in a topic, I can get a book on that topic and read through it quickly while I have a passion and interest in the book.
  8. **Portable:** I admit to not doing it very often, but if I want to, I can read on my smartphone or even my computer to continue my reading.

I highly recommend going for a Kindle. You need to read to meet your goals, and in my mind there is no better way to do so than with the Kindle.
