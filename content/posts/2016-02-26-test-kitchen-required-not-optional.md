When I first started reading through [the Learning Chef book](/learning-chef-book-review/) I became quite fascinated and enamored by [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/). The community created such a wonderful way to introduce testing into their workflow. That's fantastic!

Integration and support of Test Kitchen was one of our reasons for [partnering with Chef](/technology-partnership/). We had a way to create a test-driven infrastructure, which would be essential to truly scaling our automation to fit our vision. But, I reasoned, for now we would leave it out of the picture so we can focus on the more important tasks like developing cookbooks and establishing a [change-management workflow](/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/) that fit our broader security model.

I now see that I was looking at this all wrong.

The choice to forego testing is a common one: teams often make sure then have a core idea that will work before they invest in testing. Then they pivot very hard into the testing direction when the core is there. This is the direction I took, largely because of how we couldn't easily get Windows, Test Kitchen and vagrant to work together.

I changed my mind when I recently tried to work with a group of 25 people to learn Chef. In the workshop I asked people to set up a virtual machine somewhere, copy stuff over, get it on a chef server (or run it in local mode directly) and then watched them struggle with the nonessential details and not get much done.

The reality then dawned on me: **Test Kitchen is the only efficient way to run your cookbooks.** It's not for testing first. It's for running first. If you are a developer, you're used to coding a little and running a little. The reality all developers discovered decades ago is that **you're not going to get very far with coding unless you are running your code frequently.**

Since chef runs on an infrastructure, it's much more difficult to run. You have to run it on a virtual machine. This is what Test Kitchen is for.**** 

Using chef without Test Kitchen is like opening a restaurant and inviting everyone to taste the food without practicing with your kitchen staff first. No one would do that because it would fail miserably. The restaurant would spend a massive amount of time getting feedback on a product that they can't trust is ready for external consumption.

So my next task is to get us up and running with Test Kitchen. I now know that it's not just a nice tool for testing; it's an essential part of coding with chef.
