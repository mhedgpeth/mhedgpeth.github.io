Earlier this year, I was pretty excited about some [drastic changes](/achievable-contentment/) we had made in our lifestyle. Whenever I'm excited about something, I must tell someone and my friend at a dinner party at my house was no exception. I excitedly pointed out all the ways that simplicity has led us to a life of greater contentment and tranquility.

I could sense my friend becoming increasingly uncomfortable.

"Well, not everyone can live that way."

My friend assumed that I view life as a science; that there are certain rules that _must_ be followed and a right and wrong way to do things.

I completely disagree with that notion. To me **life is more like a work of art.** You have a canvas on which to paint decisions, consequences, and ultimately meaning. Every life is as different as every work of art.

When a painter presents her painting, she is expressing herself in a unique way that is unlike anyone else. The painter has _her_ way of painting. To her it _feels_ like the right way, because, of course, she did it that way. Another painter may do it totally differently. A wonderful and mysterious thing happens in the gallery: **each painter admires the brilliance and beauty in the other's work of art.**

So I am creating a work of art that I hope to be beautiful and meaningful.

I'm not creating a life of the entrepreneur who spends her nights and weekends creating a groundbreaking service that improves the lives of millions of people. But I can appreciate her work of art.

I'm not creating a life of the philanthropist who travels the world to find a way to cure malaria worldwide. But I can appreciate his work of art.

I'm not creating a life of the video game developer who works for two solid years to create a game that captures the imagination of a teenager who stays out of trouble because he has something to do when he's out of school. But I can appreciate his work of art.

I'm not creating a life of a hospice nurse who works the night shift helping dying patients find dignity and meaning in their final days. But I can appreciate her work of art.

I'm creating a life of tranquility, meaning, and purpose. I do this through simplifying life in every facet, achieving in the marketplace through a fearless pursuit of adding value, and creating margin in my life to build a legacy with those around me, especially my family.

This is my work of art. This is the journey I will share with you.

**It isn't the only way.**

But I want it to be beautiful, and I want to share it with you because I hope we can inspire each other to make our lives a beautiful work of art.
