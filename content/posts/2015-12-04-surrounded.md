Early in my career I was rewarded for knowing everything. People noticed when I interrupted, when I had the right answer. My boss took notice when I had the insight that he didn't have at a critical moment.

The feeling of being the one that knows is so rewarding and addictive.

It's a shame that it's so limiting.

As you grow your ability to know and recognize the problems and solutions grows. Code turns into design. Design turns into process. Process turns into strategy.

If you have to be the smartest person in the room at all times, you will simply not grow into the later stages. It's impossible.

So find a new addiction: surround yourself with people who have the answers that you used to have. Take notice at the critical moments when others stand up and reward those who fill those critical needs. And enjoy the journey into new territory that you're there to conquer: the strategy, leadership, and process that it takes for your team and organization to be successful.
