&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A lot of times in IT I&amp;rsquo;ll hear the phrase, &amp;ldquo;I was told&amp;rdquo;. For example, &amp;ldquo;I was told we are going to use Chef.&amp;rdquo; This is the worst possible phrase you can use. It suffers from two major defects:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First it uses the &lt;em>passive voice&lt;/em>. I think the passive voice is the enemy of productive and clear communication. In this context the passive voice shadows the listener from the person that did the telling and subtly tells you to not question the statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I was told to use Chef.&amp;rdquo; Who did the telling? Your mom? Your five year old son? Your boss? &lt;em>Their&lt;/em> boss? The teller implies that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter; you should just accept the statement because, &amp;ldquo;I was told&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this isn&amp;rsquo;t the worst part of the statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I was told&lt;/em> takes the teller completely out of the chain of responsibility for actions and results in their business. If &lt;em>I was told to do Chef&lt;/em> and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go well, then that&amp;rsquo;s not my fault at all. I can go about my career life with great pride in the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m only doing what I&amp;rsquo;m told and can chalk up failures to &lt;em>management&lt;/em> or &lt;em>the crazy Chef evangelist&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I was told&lt;/em> needs to die. It&amp;rsquo;s the death knell of a career. It lulls its teller into a rejection of responsibility, and their skills fade away into oblivion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a secret: even though I wrote that on the Internet for the &lt;em>whole world to hear&lt;/em>, you&amp;rsquo;re going to go to work tomorrow and hear &lt;em>I was told&lt;/em>. It will be like the car that you buy and then see it everywhere. Everyone using the passive voice! Obfuscating the actions of others into an unquestionable force that we should all follow!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And as that happens, I have some advice for you. Take charge. See what needs to change and change it. Call out a problem, suggest a solution, and solve it. Don&amp;rsquo;t complain about funding. Don&amp;rsquo;t complain about the other team that is stupid. Don&amp;rsquo;t complain about management and &lt;em>I was told&lt;/em> yourself into oblivion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stand up, take action, make the world a better place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Power of Context</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/power-of-context/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/power-of-context/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-power-of-context.jpg" alt="Power of Context" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve coached a couple of people lately who have made a career change into technology from other disciplines and have noticed a pattern emerge that I want to share more broadly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People from other disciplines bring diversity to their roles. In this context, we&amp;rsquo;re not talking about their gender or ethnicity. We&amp;rsquo;re talking about their &lt;em>background&lt;/em>. From a purely business perspective, we want higher diversity and inclusion to remove the efficiency barriers that exist from the echo chamber that is generated from only having one group present. If a disproportionate amount of women were in technology, that same echo chamber would exist and we would want to hire more men. Same with all other groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in mind, people we hire onto our teams that are in underrerpresented groups or lack the traditional indoctrination of the culture of IT through universities (i.e., are making a career change) have special powers. They can see things the rest of us can&amp;rsquo;t. They work around the echo chamber and can truly be powerful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because these people generally lack deep technical skills, they experience immense temptation to get outside of a technical role and into a &amp;ldquo;better fit&amp;rdquo;. After all, if a new DevOps Engineer is growing and only OK at coding Ansible scripts, but is removing barriers left and right on getting a critical project delivered, why not let her focus on the latter?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would be a huge mistake. Don&amp;rsquo;t do it. Stay technical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the secret: when people have the technical &lt;em>context&lt;/em> within which they can solve human and technical problems together, their value shoots through the roof.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you walk away from opportunities to deepen your technical skills in an effort to maximize your value, you&amp;rsquo;re making a huge short-sighted mistake. Without those technical skills, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to as effectively lead in the future. You&amp;rsquo;ll be a &lt;em>passenger&lt;/em> in the software value creation process. Passengers in this process don&amp;rsquo;t get compensation, respect, and rewards equal to the &lt;em>drivers&lt;/em>, or producers (unless they are in sales, which is another kind of producer).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me leave you with an example, used by permission from my wife. I and many people who know her think that Annie will be a high performing IT executive in five years. She&amp;rsquo;s got all the intangibles you need to be a VP Engineering. In order to get there, though, she needs to dive into her Chef projects for her customer, continue to build her technical skills by learning Ruby deeply, and continue to build her technical prowess. Without that, she would probably stall out and lack the direct engagement that is needed for effective executive-level management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a career change or are supporting people who are, don&amp;rsquo;t take the bait of getting a non-technical role early on. Build off of technical proficiency paired with the soft skills. Let them grow together. With that context, you&amp;rsquo;re truly on the path to long-term success.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2017 Year in Review</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/2017-year-end/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/2017-year-end/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-2017-year-end.jpg" alt="Year End" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>At the start of 2018, &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">Annie&lt;/a> and I feel like we&amp;rsquo;re at the start of a brand new journey. We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move to Boulder, Colorado in the coming months. Our jobs are going great, so we plan on working remotely with our companies after making the move. We&amp;rsquo;re both very excited about what&amp;rsquo;s in store; every time I go to the mountains I come alive in a way that no other place can match.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before moving onto this next chapter, I wanted to write about some of the great things that have happened in 2017.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the automation front, we&amp;rsquo;ve settled on an automation stack that works for us using Chef, RunDeck, ARM Templates, Hashicorp Vault, Artifactory, and Salt. I abandoned my &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/introducing-cafe/">experimental Cafe project&lt;/a> when I realized Chef was going in another direction. While that was painful to give up, I got to scratch a coding itch and realize that it was really up to me (and not a single vendor) to build the stack that solved our problems. After finalizing this approach to automation, I was able to build alignment with our central IT partners within NCR and make this our reference architecture going forward as we migrate some workloads to the cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s all very exciting and really a culmination of years of work and lots of great partnership with Chef, Inc. especially.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At work in July I took on a new challenge to migrate our critical applications to a new hardware platform that would help us grow our business. It was a unique challenge for me because we wanted to move our critical applications to this platform before our peak season which started mid-November. So much of the second half of the year I became obsessed with delivering this project. It had no &amp;ldquo;devops&amp;rdquo; associated with it, or code, or any of that. However, I loved it. I enjoyed rising to the challenge, bringing a lot of different departments together and delivering the project. Our peak season has been one of the most stable and successful yet for the critical applications we migrated, and that&amp;rsquo;s thanks to our efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In August we had a successful DevOps Days in Dallas. I was really proud of two things: first, we put together a leadership summit that attracted forty of Dallas&amp;rsquo; devops-minded IT leaders. I really enjoyed being in that group and thinking about DevOps from a strategic/leadership perspective. I was also proud of how well my friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MeganBohl">Megan Bohl&lt;/a> did as a sponsor liason and that we were able to get her a scholarship to &lt;a href="https://www.techtalentsouth.com/">Tech Talent South&lt;/a>. Stay tuned with Megan; she&amp;rsquo;s going to be a star.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This past year I was also impressed with Annie&amp;rsquo;s growth. She started the year only a few months into the job and very much struggling to put it all together and get herself on billable jobs. It felt at the beginning of the year like she was battling uphill for success in the industry. And along the way there were lots of people (don&amp;rsquo;t worry, we&amp;rsquo;re not mad at you) who suggested that Annie should be in a non-technical role.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of giving up, Annie dug in and studied hard. When the opportunities came, she worked extra and I watched the kids. She got help wherever she could get it. In May she got a particularly challenging make-it-or-break-it project, and her colleague Scott Nowicki spent time after hours walking her through the challenges she was having so she could deliver. That was a huge turning point for her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another huge turning point was when her CEO helped her realize that if she wanted to be technical, she needed to &lt;em>focus&lt;/em> on that and stop speaking, blogging, marketing so much. That was the absolute right advice she needed right then. A lot of people would see her talents and say &amp;ldquo;you should be blogging!&amp;rdquo; but then ignore the technical skills that were growing so rapidly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which reminds me of a third turning point for me personally. At DevOps Days, after our speaker dinner, Adam Jacob and John Willis heard our story and they both remarked at how unusually talented Annie is as a technologist. I must admit I had become blind to that reality because I had spent the last year working with her at the edge of her abilities. But the truth was evident: it&amp;rsquo;s not normal going from nothing to knowing InSpec in two weeks enough to write tutorials on it. It&amp;rsquo;s not normal to accomplish what she has accomplished, because, frankly, she&amp;rsquo;s good at it. She&amp;rsquo;s abnormally good. She has the potential to be a technical game changer for a valuable business. That makes me so glad she&amp;rsquo;s stayed on the path she&amp;rsquo;s on as a technologist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Late in the year Annie started working on a long-term contract with a company to help them with their Chef and Azure workloads. She&amp;rsquo;s integrated InSpec into their workflow and has done so much more than that. She loves finding the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way that aligns with the business objectives and challenges. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how much she&amp;rsquo;s able to accomplish there in the coming months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been an amazing journey to see Annie transform like this. Years ago I&amp;rsquo;d come home from work and she would be taking wood from the side of the road and turn it into something beautiful and useful. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see her be able to transform those skills and that work ethic into a fantastic technical engineering position. And this is only the beginning!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next year I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on two things:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First I&amp;rsquo;m going to move to Boulder and find my place in that community. There are a lot of differences between Dallas and Boulder and I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that I can fit in. I&amp;rsquo;m there for more personal reasons: I want to bike everywhere, I want to live in a smaller place, and I want to hike up mountains. I would also love to snow ski for the first time. Moving to Boulder really is a dream come true!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, next year I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing more on the broader elements of our DevOps transformation journey at NCR. I am looking forward to influencing our growth and transformation beyond just code and automation improvements. I want to dramatically improve what we do and what we can do. I&amp;rsquo;m more excited than ever about the new challenges before me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think there will ever be another 2017 for Annie and me. It was a year of dramatic growth for both of us. We started the year both not quite sure about our futures, but finish off as valuable contributors of our companies and so happy about how we are both growing. My mantra has always been to go for growth first and everything else will follow. That&amp;rsquo;s where I feel we both are at, and I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to see where this takes us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, thanks to everyone who have supported us along the way. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done what we did without you. You know who you are, and believe us, we are so incredibly grateful for your support, friendship, and love.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Your First DevOps Project</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/devops-project/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/devops-project/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-devops-project.jpg" alt="Devops Project" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I was at lunch with my friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MeganBohl">Megan Bohl&lt;/a> who is a fellow &lt;a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-dallas/">DevOps Days Organizer&lt;/a>, and is taking a DevOps course with &lt;a href="https://www.techtalentsouth.com/">Tech Talent South&lt;/a>. Megan is finishing her course in a few weeks and is ready to go find a DevOps job. However, like many people learning about this stuff for the first time, Megan wants to bring everything together into a nice project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before lunch, I spoke with Megan and her class about how it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to know the context and problems that different technologies address in order to properly understand and properly be prepared for a DevOps Engineering position. So with that in mind, I&amp;rsquo;ll propose a project that Megan and anyone can do to get a basic feel for what DevOps is all about. Hopefully this can be used by a lot of people to get their feet wet with DevOps automation tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to follow along in the project, please do it in order. Don&amp;rsquo;t skip any steps. And if you get to a point where you&amp;rsquo;re thinking &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about git!&amp;rdquo; or whatever, have no fear. Stop, spend some time on learning git, and then keep going. You can do this project without any previous technology experience, assuming you have someone helping you look in the right places. And that&amp;rsquo;s the final thing: use this as a guide to get you on your way but find a technical friend to sponsor your learning and interact with you. That will be huge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll deliver the project in phases:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="phase-1-simple-website">Phase 1: Simple Website&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create an account on &lt;a href="GitHub">https://github.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a repository named &lt;code>website&lt;/code> on GitHub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clone your &lt;code>website&lt;/code> repository locally using your terminal (&lt;code>Terminal&lt;/code> on a mac or &lt;code>PowerShell&lt;/code> on windows).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a branch called &lt;code>feature_index&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add an &lt;code>index.html&lt;/code> to the branch that says &lt;code>Hello, World!&lt;/code> in the text. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to make the change with &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check that in&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a pull request for your branch to be merged into &lt;code>master&lt;/code> and assign the pull request to your mentor. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a mentor, assign it to me, &lt;code>mhedgpeth&lt;/code>! :)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Merge your pull request into &lt;code>master&lt;/code> after it&amp;rsquo;s approved&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-were-learning">What We&amp;rsquo;re Learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to work well with DevOps automation and tooling, you need to know the basics about source control and editing code. This gives you that foundation. It also gives us something to deploy in future phases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="resources-for-phase-1">Resources for Phase 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">Try Git in 15 minutes&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">Codecademy Learn HTML&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="phase-2-simple-webserver">Phase 2: Simple Webserver&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Now that you have a website, you want to now create a webserver. This is a machine that will provide other machines the contents of your &lt;code>index.html&lt;/code> file from phase 1. This machine will be a linux machine hosted on &lt;a href="https://portal.azure.com">Microsoft Azure Cloud&lt;/a> with &lt;a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx&lt;/a> running on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create an account on Azure and activate your &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/">free trial&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create an ubuntu virtual machine on Azure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SSH to that machine. If you&amp;rsquo;re on windows use &lt;a href="http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/need-an-ssh-client-on-windows-dont-use-putty-or-cygwinuse-git">Matt Wrock&amp;rsquo;s guide&lt;/a> to getting a ssh client.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=set+up+nginx+on+ubuntu">Set up nginx on the machine&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clone your git repository to &lt;code>/var/www/html&lt;/code> on the server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the public ip assigned to your ubuntu server, access the website (i.e. &lt;code>http://[your-ip]&lt;/code>). Your website should show up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Have a friend on another computer do this. They should see the website too. Magical!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-were-learning-1">What We&amp;rsquo;re Learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My friend Nathan Harvey has said to me that you can&amp;rsquo;t automate that which you do not understand. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to &amp;ldquo;do the DevOps&amp;rdquo; but can&amp;rsquo;t do it manually, then you&amp;rsquo;re going too fast! So we&amp;rsquo;re learning the basics here of setting up a machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="resources-for-phase-2">Resources for Phase 2&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal">Setting Up Linux Virtual Machine on Azure&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="phase-3-deploy-a-change">Phase 3: Deploy a Change&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to deploy a change! Let&amp;rsquo;s do this the old fashioned way the first time around.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create a new branch on your repository named &lt;code>feature_myname&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Update &lt;code>index.html&lt;/code> to say &amp;ldquo;Hello, Michael!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a pull request, get it reviewed, and merge it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On your webserver, update your &lt;code>index.html&lt;/code> file from GitHub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Get on twitter and send me a message @michaelhedgpeth with a link. Show me that I didn&amp;rsquo;t waste my time! :)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-were-learning-2">What We&amp;rsquo;re Learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is how a majority of people have deployed things for a long time. The manual way. You can&amp;rsquo;t realize what problems different tools solve before you do it manually. I&amp;rsquo;m purposely not giving you the exact steps to follow because I want you to find those steps on your own or with a mentor. Google it! This is how you learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="phase-4-create-a-chef-cookbook-to-automate-machine-setup">Phase 4: Create a Chef Cookbook to Automate Machine Setup&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Now think about what your life would be like if you had to do the above steps thousands of times on hundreds of servers. Your life would not be fun, and in addition to that you would have hundreds of servers that were all a little bit different because, over time, you weren&amp;rsquo;t consistent. This is why you use something like Chef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a big technical jump from the previous phases. Take your time here. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never done this stuff you might spend a couple of weeks on it. You&amp;rsquo;ll have questions. Get on the &lt;a href="http://chefcommunity.slack.com">Chef Community Slack&lt;/a> and post them on the #general channel. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid; we all were here and support you!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>On GitHub create a repository called &lt;code>my_website&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clone that repository locally and switch to a branch called &lt;code>feature_nginx&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up &lt;code>nginx&lt;/code> using the &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/resource_package.html">package&lt;/a> resource&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use &lt;a href="https://kitchen.ci/">Test Kitchen&lt;/a> to make sure your cookbook installs the package. Use kitchen with a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">Policyfile&lt;/a>. There will be a &lt;code>Policyfile.rb&lt;/code> in the cookbook that defines your run list if you&amp;rsquo;re doing this right.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write an &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com/inspec/">Inspec Test&lt;/a> that ensures the package is installed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a PR and get it merged&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create another branch called &lt;code>feature_website&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/resource_git.html">git resource&lt;/a> clone your repository on GitHub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write another inspec test to make sure that the website is served when you go to &lt;code>http://localhost&lt;/code> and that the contents contain &amp;ldquo;Hello, Michael!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure that &lt;code>kitchen test&lt;/code> works&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Pull Request and Merge into master&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="phase-5-deploy-your-chef-cookbook-to-azure">Phase 5: Deploy Your Chef Cookbook to Azure&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to use your Chef Cookbook as a way to not have to manually deploy and update your machine. After you do this step, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to consistently create as many machines as you want, with very little effort!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create a new virtual machine on Azure using the portal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create an account and organization on &lt;a href="http://manage.chef.io">manage.chef.io&lt;/a>. If you did the learn chef rally above, you should already have this set up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Push your cookbook policy to the chef server (see my &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">blog post&lt;/a> for the exact command.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/install_bootstrap.html">Bootstrap your node&lt;/a> with the chef server. This will run the policy on that node, setting up nginx and everything!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hit the public IP associated with the node and see that it serves your website perfectly! Magic!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now deploy a new change to your website and call it &amp;ldquo;Hello, Automated World!&amp;rdquo;. Tell me about it (@michaelhedgpeth on twitter). I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a high five for getting this far!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-were-learning-3">What We&amp;rsquo;re Learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Hopefully you see the benefits of automating the setup of the machine. From now on, everything is consistent and just works. Your drama for making changes goes down. And you can do this as many times as it&amp;rsquo;s called for!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="phase-6-automate-creation-of-vms-in-azure-with-terraform">Phase 6: Automate Creation of VMs in Azure with Terraform&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Now that we have a Virtual Machine that we can easily set up, you might be tempted to quit. But there&amp;rsquo;s something lingering there: even though you automated what was &lt;em>inside&lt;/em> of the virtual machine, you still have to manually set up the machine itself. This is easy enough when you have one machine, but what if you have hundreds? That&amp;rsquo;s where Terraform comes in:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create a new repository in GitHub called &lt;code>website_provision&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In that repo, create a terraform script that creates a virtual machine within a network with an external ip address&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make your terraform script bootstrap the VM with your Chef Server and assign it to your policy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wath with awe how terraform allows you to create and destroy your &lt;em>entire&lt;/em> stack, all the way from the machines itself to what&amp;rsquo;s on the machines (with Chef).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-were-learning-4">What We&amp;rsquo;re Learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The environment within which your application runs is one of the most complicated aspecs of the application. Thus, you should invest in automating that and keeping yourself away from the user interface. Terraform is a great tool for this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now that we have an automated process that will deploy our stuff, we want to make our workflow easy to execute with Jenkins. Before you move on I highly recommend Wes Higbee&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jenkins-2-getting-started">Jenkins class on Pluralsight&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s well worth the trouble. That will give you the context you need to go through these steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create a rakefile for your &lt;code>my_website&lt;/code> cookbook using [my blog post])(&lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-development-with-rakefile/">http://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-development-with-rakefile/&lt;/a>) as a guide.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a &lt;code>Jenkinsfile&lt;/code> for your cookbook using &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/">my blog post&lt;/a> as a guide&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Jenkins server. If you took the class you may already have one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Jenkins build for &lt;code>my_website&lt;/code> that runs on all branches (using the multi-branch pipeline, as Wes explains in the course)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a branch called &lt;code>broken&lt;/code> and add code that will break your cookbook&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check it into the branch, and watch Jenkins tell you it&amp;rsquo;s broken!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-were-learning-5">What We&amp;rsquo;re Learning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re automatically providing the accountability people need to know that their software still works. It&amp;rsquo;s better to learn that &lt;em>as&lt;/em> you&amp;rsquo;re making the changes rather than when they get to production. So Jenkins helps us see how, when we change software over time, that software still meets our expectations. It reinforces the best practices for your team: you should run test kitchen before checking in changes. The safety imposed by Jenkins will keep you on the straight and narrow path!&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I think if you do the above project, you&amp;rsquo;ll be well on your way to getting things working. Here are some other ideas, for extra credit:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>With &lt;a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Hashicorp Vault&lt;/a> store a secret and have your chef cookbook (using the vault gem) read the secret and write it to your web page&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Jenkins pipeline that will deploy your terraform templates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Instead of using Chef, use Docker (perhaps with Habitat) to deploy your application&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Hopefully this project will give you the context to know the basics of automating infrastructure. With this basis under your belt, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make great progress in whatever situation you find yourself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chef is a Community Before It's a Vendor</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-community/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-community/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-chef-community.jpg" alt="Chef Community" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Back in October, I was frustrated. I had invested deeply into a new feature Chef had made called &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">Policyfiles&lt;/a> and had seen it not be adopted. I met in an intense meeting with their product management team trying to figure out exactly how I be able to migrate off of the feature and onto the platform that everyone else was on. I was involved in a typical vendor situation where what I was doing wasn&amp;rsquo;t aligned with their direction and I was feeling some pain because of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then an unexpected thing happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day, at Chef Community Summit, a VP at Chef got up in front of everyone and told &lt;em>us&lt;/em> to suggest topics. I submitted a policyfiles topic and showed up to the session, surprised by the number of people who attended. I went through the pros and cons of the feature and the feature seemed to resonate with the audience. The same product management team I was working with the day before attended, had a great attidude, listened, were interested and engaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It then dawned on me: working with Chef Software Inc. is indeed working with a vendor, but it&amp;rsquo;s much more than that. Their DNA came about within an open source community, and their value is tied up within a community collaborating to make their product better. So rather than shut me down, they encouraged me. Even when they disagreed with me. I was a member of their community so I could propose whatever I wanted, and if there was a benefit to that community then they were all for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So after the Chef Community Summit I wrote some blog posts, went on the Food Fight Show, and answered questions on slack on the #policyfile channel. I also worked with Chef Software Inc. as a customer to make sure they understood how central policyfiles were to our workflow and success with chef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They listened, they changed their approach, and they even let me talk about it on Wednesday at 2PM at Chef Conf. Almost three years ago, I started down a path of figuring out who we would partner with to change operations for NCR&amp;rsquo;s Hospitality products. I recognized even then that Chef, Inc. has a different kind of DNA. Yes, there is a sales organization (and they&amp;rsquo;re great). Yes there are contracts, and we pay money. But the best part of it all is that I&amp;rsquo;m a part of a larger community that is all pointed in the same direction: we want to change the fundamentals of IT and help traditional businesses make that transformation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a technical problem, a cultural problem, an organizational problem, and I feel so fortunate and blessed to be able to solve it with such a great community of like-minded people.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chef Artifacts with Artifactory</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/artifactory/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/artifactory/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-artifactory.jpg" alt="Artifactory" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re going to deploy anything, you&amp;rsquo;ll eventually come across a fundamental need: you need somewhere to put your large files. At first, Chef seems like an attractive choice for this, but on deeper inspection it&amp;rsquo;s a horrible path to take. Chef is really great at delivering idempotent scripts to your machines to test and repair. It&amp;rsquo;s not that great of a file server. Storing your files in Chef will make your cookbooks more bloated, your source code repositories more bloated, and cause pain all around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it&amp;rsquo;s been a pleasure recently to discover how great artifactory is for a tool for managing artifacts for deployments. Artifactory very naturally and easily lets you get up and running with hosting artifacts in a safe and scalable way. I&amp;rsquo;d like to lay out a bit of how we use artifactory for those interested in using it for themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="licensing">Licensing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, I &lt;em>really&lt;/em> want to give artifactory my money, but there is a budget cycle to fend with, and besides people don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend money unless they can see the value they&amp;rsquo;re getting. So this post will be based on the &lt;em>free&lt;/em> version of artifactory. Fortunately, the free version contains what we need; we just need to host artifacts and call it good. Later we can get into the fancypants gem repos, supermarket, artifact expiration features. For now let&amp;rsquo;s ship it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was quite delightful for me to get artifactory up and running. In evaluation mode I did this with docker:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="docker">Docker&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I first just pull the image:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>docker pull docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss:latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>And then run the container:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>docker run --name artifactory -d -p 8081:8081 docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss:latest
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>I then navigate my browser to &lt;code>http://localhost:8081&lt;/code> and I&amp;rsquo;m immediately using artifactory. This was an excellent example of &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com/docker">inverted learning&lt;/a> that Annie loves to talk about.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="package-installation">Package Installation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For those of us freaked out about running Docker in production, artifactory&amp;rsquo;s package installation is pretty good as well:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>wget https://bintray.com/jfrog/artifactory-rpms/rpm -O bintray-jfrog-artifactory-rpms.repo
sudo mv bintray-jfrog-artifactory-rpms.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo yum install jfrog-artifactory-oss
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really that easy. They did a fantastic job of making it easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="uploading">Uploading&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Creating and uploading artifacts with artifactory is easy to intuit on their web UI. For CI jobs, we&amp;rsquo;ve found that the &lt;a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/JFrog+CLI">&lt;code>jfrog.exe&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is a really nice way of making uploads easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This way &lt;a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory#CLIforJFrogArtifactory-Configuration">you can store your authentication credentials&lt;/a> for uploading to artifactory on your build agents in a &lt;code>~/.jfrog/jfrog-cli.conf&lt;/code> file. This way your usage of the &lt;code>jfrog.exe&lt;/code> can be very simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can &lt;a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory#CLIforJFrogArtifactory-UploadingFiles">upload&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>jfrog rt u *.tgz product-repo/policyfile-archives
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>And you can &lt;a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory#CLIforJFrogArtifactory-DownloadingFiles">download&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>jfrog rt dl product-repo/policyfile-archives/webserver-3498732hjfkdlsfdahlfewlrhewkl.tgz
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re doing it right, that&amp;rsquo;s about all that you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="access-control">Access Control&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For any automation situation, you want to create access control to the assets of that automation. That way you prevent, at many levels, the situation where your scripts accidentally deploy the same product on all your nodes. If you keep access restricted, you keep things happening the way you&amp;rsquo;d say they would happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, artifactory allows for &lt;a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Managing+Users">users to be created&lt;/a> for this very purpose. So each of your products could have its own artifactory user, which would only be granted access to the repositories you say it should.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="chef-integration">Chef Integration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Fortunately, artifactory provides an http api that works very nicely with the &lt;code>remote_file&lt;/code> resource:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">remote_file &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;C:\cafe\staging\chef-client-13.0.118-1-x64.msi&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">do&lt;/span>
source &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;https://productuser:mypassw0rd@artifactory.mycompany.com/artifactory/chef-repo/chef-client-13.0.118-1-x64.msi&amp;#39;&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can &lt;a href="https://coderanger.net/chef-tips/#3">create a module&lt;/a> that will build your url for you and make it even easier:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">remote_file &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;C:\cafe\staging\chef-client-13.0.118-1-x64.msi&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">do&lt;/span>
extends &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">Artifactory&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">UrlResolver&lt;/span>
source artifactory_url &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;chef-repo/chef-client-13.0.118-1-x64.msi&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
checksum &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;c594965648e20a2339d6f33d236b4e3e22b2be6916cceb1b0f338c74378c03da&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Having an https url is great because I can use a lot of third party chef cookbooks that just need a URL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have even taken it a step further and developed our own custom resource:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">artifactory_file &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;C:\cafe\staging\chef-client-13.0.118-1-x64.msi&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">do&lt;/span>
repsoitory_path &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;chef-repo/chef-client-13.0.118-1-x64.msi&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
checksum &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;c594965648e20a2339d6f33d236b4e3e22b2be6916cceb1b0f338c74378c03da&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will automatically determine the artifactory path we use to all of our cookbooks that just want to download a file can be easier to code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="checksum-validation">Checksum Validation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You should be checking checksums on all downloads. Fortunately the &lt;code>remote_file&lt;/code> resource gives you a built-in way to do this. Simply add the &lt;code>checksum&lt;/code> attribute to your resource and you have checking. That way if your files are tampered with or not what you expected, you don&amp;rsquo;t go ahead; you stop right there. That&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;limit the damage when things go wrong&amp;rdquo; principle at work again. This is something I learned well from my security friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Artifactory is a fantastic an essential ally to Chef in your search for DevOps nirvana. I highly recommend it over the other alternatives: Nexus by Sonatype and your own SFTP server. We&amp;rsquo;re extremely happy with this product.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chef Rollback with Policyfiles and Cafe</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-rollback/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-rollback/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-chef-rollback.jpg" alt="Failure Masquerading as Success" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When we first looked at application release automation tools, one of the first things people told me we needed was a solid rollback mechanism. One of my colleagues even insisted without satisfying his rollback scenarios, it was silly even looking at a tool for application release automation. I can definitely understand the sentiment; when you&amp;rsquo;re doing a change and that change goes badly you really want to have a mechanism to get out of that bad situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would be fantastic if we had a time machine and were able to simply tell ourselves &amp;ldquo;stop!&amp;rdquo; But in lieu of that, we have to devise a plan for when we need to get out of a change we made, we are able to do so safely.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="policyfiles-simplify-rollback">Policyfiles Simplify Rollback&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Fortunately, we have the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">policyfiles&lt;/a> feature at our disposal which makes &lt;strong>everything&lt;/strong> in this area so much simpler. In the classical Chef model, your rollback might be a rollback change to an environment pin, or a role, or a cookbook, or a combination of all of these. And if you, like most people in a panic, made some on the fly changes to any of these, good luck with getting out of that mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With policyfiles, rollback of your Chef code is quite easy; you simply upload the old version of the policy to the Chef server and reconverge your nodes. That&amp;rsquo;s it. It&amp;rsquo;s virtually impossible to get yourself into a mess where you can&amp;rsquo;t somehow &amp;ldquo;remember&amp;rdquo; what your rollback was.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="with-a-defined-deployment-its-even-simpler">With a Defined Deployment Its Even Simpler&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>And, now that I&amp;rsquo;ve shown you how you can do a controlled, atomic deployment with a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-deployment-with-cafe-and-psake/">policyfile deployment&lt;/a>, things get even easier! You &lt;strong>just&lt;/strong> went to Jenkins and uploaded policy &lt;code>1.0.32&lt;/code> for your nodes related to product X. Things went south. Now go back to that same place and enter in &lt;code>1.0.31&lt;/code> and roll out that new policy to all your nodes, safely and immediately with &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/introducing-cafe/">cafe&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="sometimes-a-data-bag-will-suffice">Sometimes a Data Bag will Suffice&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re just dealing with whether you&amp;rsquo;re going to deploy version &lt;code>A&lt;/code> or &lt;code>B&lt;/code> of your application, with Chef you can just store which version you&amp;rsquo;re on in a Data Bag. If your Chef code doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to change, a &amp;ldquo;rollback&amp;rdquo; is simply an update of your Data Bag and then a convergence with cafe. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it a best practice to decouple my Chef code, wrapped in policies, with what version my application is on, stored in Data Bags.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="code-a-rollback-in-critical-situations">Code a Rollback in Critical Situations&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It would be silly of me to suggest merely rolling back chef code and product code are enough to satisfy a true rollback. In some situations that isn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient. Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a situation like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Version 1.0
website myweb exists
Version 2.0
website myweb exists
website newmicroservice exists
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>And let&amp;rsquo;s say you went from version &lt;code>1.0&lt;/code> to version &lt;code>2.0&lt;/code>. And things went south, so you rolled back. In this situation, with Chef you would still have &lt;code>newmicoservice&lt;/code> there. So to facilitate this kind of change, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Version 1.0
website myweb exists
Version 1.1
website myweb exists
website newmicroservice DOES NOT exist
Version 2.0
website myweb exists
website newmicroservice exists
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Here you&amp;rsquo;re giving your Chef code an ability to roll back and undo stuff you plan on doing in the future. This is smart planning. I recommend it for any time a product adds new features; always add a version of the cookbook (or better yet, an attribute to a cookbook) that will turn that thing off, so if you need to roll back you can roll back safely.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Hopefully by now you can see that the rollback mechanisms offered by Chef Policyfiles are an excellent alternative to the coded rollback in other application release automation tools. In addition to this, you get all of the fantastic elements of infrastructure as code with Chef and infrastructure testing with InSpec. The holistic approach is what gets you a full solution that will create the velocity you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cafe Cookbook</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/cafe-cookbook/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/cafe-cookbook/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-cafe-cookbook.jpg" alt="Cafe Cookbook" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>With a &lt;a href="policyfile-deployment-with-cafe-and-psake">solid deployment pipeline&lt;/a> in place for running Chef that depends on &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/introducing-cafe/">Cafe&lt;/a> for a safe, atomic, and controlled rollout of Chef &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">policy&lt;/a> changes, it has become more important than ever to utilize &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/introducing-cafe/">cafe&lt;/a> to manage itself and Chef on a machine. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/mhedgpeth/cafe-cookbook">&lt;code>cafe&lt;/code> cookbook&lt;/a> does just that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cafe cookbook makes it easy to ensure that Cafe is installed and configured properly on a machine and will manage Chef upgrades that happen outside of when Chef runs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It does this very easily by giving you access to two resources:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cafe-resource">&lt;code>cafe&lt;/code> resource&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To install and configure Cafe, you should use the &lt;code>cafe&lt;/code> resource, for example:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">cafe &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;cafe&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">do&lt;/span>

installer &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;cafe-win10-x64-0.9.2.0.zip&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
cafe_install_root &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;D:&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
chef_interval &lt;span style="color:#099">1800&lt;/span>
service_port &lt;span style="color:#099">59320&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mhedgpeth/cafe/releases">Cafe Releases&lt;/a> page to get the &lt;code>download_source&lt;/code>, &lt;code>version&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>installer&lt;/code> that you need to use. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to calculate your own checksum at the moment. The last three properties are configuration elements of Cafe itself; if you omit them, the resource will use sensible default values.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should also notice that this resource is very friendly to air-gapped environments; you can use any URL you need to use here, as long as you get it downloaded and it matches the checksum. We use &lt;a href="https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/">artifactory&lt;/a> for our artifacts and love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are introducing Cafe to existing Chef nodes because you want to manage Chef that way now, and your &lt;code>cafe_install_root&lt;/code> is set to &lt;code>D:&lt;/code>, it will dutifully install Cafe for the first time in &lt;code>D:\chef&lt;/code>. On an upgrade, the &lt;code>cafe&lt;/code> service asks its &lt;code>cafe Updater&lt;/code> service friend to update &lt;code>cafe&lt;/code> for it, because services can&amp;rsquo;t update themselves. This all happens after the Chef run is finished, assuming that Cafe is running Chef.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cafe_chef-resource">&lt;code>cafe_chef&lt;/code> resource&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll also want to keep the &lt;code>chef-client&lt;/code> application up to date and consistent on all of your nodes. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to make sure you do this when Chef is not running as well. Fortunately, Cafe has you covered in this regard. Simply declare what you want Chef to look like on the machine, and Cafe handles the rest:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">cafe_chef &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;chef-client&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">do&lt;/span>

installer &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;chef-client-13.0.118-1-x64.msi&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
download_checksum &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;c594965648e20a2339d6f33d236b4e3e22b2be6916cceb1b0f338c74378c03da&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
version &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;13.0.118&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
cafe_install_root &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;D:&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>As with the scenario above, you can use any source you want from a private repository like artifactory. This is the equivalent of running &lt;code>cafe chef download 13.0.118&lt;/code> and then &lt;code>cafe install chef 13.0.118&lt;/code> but gives you more control to download the file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you can omit the &lt;code>cafe_install_root&lt;/code> if you want to install everything on &lt;code>C:&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand what exactly is happening here, because this is at the genesis of why Cafe exists. You would expect Cafe to be &lt;em>running&lt;/em> Chef at this moment, so you don&amp;rsquo;t want it to upgrade Chef immediately. So here we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> upgrading Chef, we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>requesting&lt;/strong> that Cafe upgrade Chef after the Chef client runs. The &lt;em>desired state&lt;/em> of the system is &amp;ldquo;I want Cafe to make the Chef client be on version 13.0.118&amp;rdquo;. Cafe handles the rest!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about timing here. Cafe runs &lt;strong>all&lt;/strong> of its jobs sequentially because it knows that you don&amp;rsquo;t want things stepping on other things. So sleep peacefully, my friend!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I hope you&amp;rsquo;re as excited as I am about the promise Cafe brings to the Chef runtime. With Cafe, you can still use Chef to manage itself and Cafe on an application, but you can trust that Cafe will handle this management with grace and no drama. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in deploying or contributing to Cafe, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you about it. I think it addresses a critical need within the Chef ecosystem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Policyfile Deployment with Cafe and Psake</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-deployment-with-cafe-and-psake/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-deployment-with-cafe-and-psake/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Our &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-development-with-rakefile/">cookbook builds&lt;/a> make a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/">pipeline&lt;/a> which places them into a private supermarket. Then separate &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/">policyfile repository pipelines&lt;/a> grouped by product get uploaded to an artifactory server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now for the exciting part: In an air-gapped environment, we can easily update all the things chef-related and do that within a transactional interaction with the Chef Server and all of its nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the part where my project &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/introducing-cafe/">cafe&lt;/a> really shines. In this situation where you&amp;rsquo;re rolling out a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">policy&lt;/a> to a Chef Server, you might have a lot of issues; you might have to wait an indeterminate time for chef to run on each node. You may not be able to predict if all the right policies hit the nodes when they run next. It&amp;rsquo;s a very scary moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we can automate that crazy situation and make it a peaceful, good situation. We do that with cafe and &lt;a href="https://github.com/psake/psake">psake&lt;/a> a powershell-based automation mechanism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why psake? Within our windows-heavy environment people want to see powershell. So it makes sense for us to orchestrate our deployment of chef changes with a powershell-based mechanism. If I was in a ruby shop I&amp;rsquo;d probably use rake. Whatever it takes; the main requirements are that it be a staged model where if a stage fails then the execution stops. Pretty much any make-based system will do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="psake-deployment-script-with-cafe">Psake Deployment Script with Cafe&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>So let&amp;rsquo;s jump into our &lt;code>deploy.ps1&lt;/code> which is our script to deploy all the things to the Chef Server and rerun Chef on all the servers:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">properties {

}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I really love how readable and self-documenting this is. So much so, that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like I have to explain it. What I will say is that we follow this workflow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Pause Chef (get into maintenance mode)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Push policies to Chef Server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Converge All Nodes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Resume Chef&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The control and safety here should make every Chef user giddy with excitement. This change event is so scary, that you need safety around it. Coupled with Policyfiles, cafe brings you that safety, and if you agree I would love your help making cafe everything it should be within the Chef ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="pipeline-for-deployment">Pipeline for Deployment&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ll remember from the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/">policyfile pipeline&lt;/a> post, everything described above is packaged &lt;strong>with&lt;/strong> the policyfile archives. So this is the script that runs within the context of those other files. We have &lt;strong>one package&lt;/strong>, versioned by Jenkins, that we can upload to do an atomic update of everything related to Chef, then reconverge the nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now that we have this file available on our artifacts server, it&amp;rsquo;s time to run a deployment. With an air-gapped environment, the source of these files might be different, or you might get those files to their destination in a variety of ways. However, the basics remain the same from a pipeline perspective: you need to download the file, unzip it, and run the script. Here is an example &lt;code>Jenkinsfile&lt;/code> that does just this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-groovy" data-lang="groovy">archiveName &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;myproduct_policies_${policiesVersion}.zip&amp;#34;&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#458;font-weight:bold">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#900;font-weight:bold">invoke_psake&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">(){&lt;/span>

unstash &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;everything&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
invoke_psake&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">()&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">}&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that. In Jenkins we make &lt;code>policiesVersion&lt;/code> a parameter and all of the sudden we have a parameterized build of versioned grouped policies that happen in an ATOMIC update, with immediate node convergence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I love taking the complexity of all those Chef scripts, on all those nodes, and narrowing them down to a single file that gets deployed to a target environment. This is exactly what the developers have been doing for some time; it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see my Chef workflow catch up with that goodness. In a change management situation, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>very clear&lt;/em> what&amp;rsquo;s happening here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One improvement I want to make soon: I&amp;rsquo;d like to have a file checksum added as a parameter to the Jenkins job. That way if someone accidentally fat fingered the wrong version, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t accidentally get the wrong version deployed. Everything needs a safety net.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Policyfile Pipeline with Jenkinsfile</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-policyfile-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile.jpg" alt="Policyfile Pipeline with Jenkinsfile" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge proponent of &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">policyfiles&lt;/a> for managing Chef changes in all of your environments. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk a little about how we take a policyfile and create a pipeline in Jenkins around it to get it deployed to the right places.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many environments that aren&amp;rsquo;t as security-conscious will have a single Chef Server to rule them all, connected to a single CI server. This is the model that &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/workflow.html">Chef Workflow&lt;/a> assumes, and it&amp;rsquo;s a nice situation to be in. In those situations, the pipeline I lay out will be much simpler, but I still recommend following the basic pieces. Since it&amp;rsquo;s more complicated and therefore covers all the bases, we&amp;rsquo;ll go for a disconnected, releasable pipeline that can and will traverse the development to operations barrier that many security-minded organizations have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For our policyfiles pipeline, we create a similar process to our cookbooks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We keep a separate &lt;code>policies&lt;/code> git repo for each product group of policies that we have. &lt;strong>We don&amp;rsquo;t keep the policyfiles in the cookbook.&lt;/strong> This is largely because we want to have our own pipeline for policies that is &lt;strong>unrelated&lt;/strong> to the cookbook pipeline. The cookbook pipeline will promote a cookbook to a &lt;em>supermarket&lt;/em>, and the policy will pull the cookbook &lt;em>from&lt;/em> that supermarket. This creates two separate processes that have a beginning and end, but are disconnected, so allow for independence. This is a critical aspect to designing any pipeline, and one I&amp;rsquo;ll blog about in the near future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have a &lt;code>rakefile&lt;/code> for doing tasks that can be done locally on a developer machine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We then put that into a pipeline with a &lt;code>Jenkinsfile&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s first look at the &lt;code>rakefile&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="policyfile-rakefile">Policyfile Rakefile&lt;/h1>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s unpack this a little bit. Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s going on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>compile_poilcies&lt;/strong> will run &lt;code>chef install&lt;/code> against all files that have the pattern &lt;code>myproduct-*.rb&lt;/code>. So it basicaly generates the &lt;code>Policyfile.lock.json&lt;/code> for all the policies in the repo.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>export_policies&lt;/strong> will export all policies to a &lt;code>tgz&lt;/code> file with &lt;code>chef export&lt;/code> command.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>stage&lt;/strong> will stage all the things that are to be packaged into a &lt;code>staging&lt;/code> folder including the deployment scripts written in psake (more on that in the next post).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>package&lt;/strong> will package the &lt;code>tgz&lt;/code> file and the deployment scripts into a package&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="policyfile-jenkinsfile">Policyfile Jenkinsfile&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Now that we have a rakefile that can do the work we need, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to get that into a &lt;code>Jenkinsfile&lt;/code> to describe the pipeline. The pipeline will create a package of all policyfile archives and put them, with the script that will deploy them, on our artifactory server. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can see a pattern here with the pipelines from the earlier post on &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-development-with-rakefile/">cookbook build&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/">cookbook pipelines&lt;/a>. They rely on script that can run locally, then end up being deployed to something that is a source of the next step in the process. More on that in the next post: how we deploy these policies to a Chef Server and reconverge the nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;re starting to see the pattern I use when designing a pipeline element in my Chef Pipeline. Everything has a starting point and a destination. Every pipeline &lt;em>segment&lt;/em> will take a &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; input and put it into an &amp;ldquo;even more stable&amp;rdquo; location at the end. It all flows together very quickly and then allows for quick changes that can flow to production.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cookbook Pipeline with Jenkinsfile</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-cookbook-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile.jpg" alt="Pipeline with Jenkinsfile" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Now that we have a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-development-with-rakefile/">local cookbook build&lt;/a> ready to go, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get that in a CI environment. I have been a fan of &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity">TeamCity&lt;/a> and my friends at Chef have a done a great job with &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/workflow.html">Chef Workflow in Automate&lt;/a>. For us, however, &lt;a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins&lt;/a> is our tool of choice with managing our deployment pipelines, for a few reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Jenkins is &lt;strong>free&lt;/strong>. We are able to get done what we need inside of the free version, so it&amp;rsquo;s nice that we don&amp;rsquo;t have or need a license or support.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jenkins is &lt;strong>flexible&lt;/strong>. We have complicated requirements around security, and Jenkins has been easy to bend to those requirements without requiring a lot of fuss.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jenkins is &lt;strong>friendly to a pipeline mindset&lt;/strong>. Compared to TeamCity, Jenkins is much better at laying out a workflow and walking through the various stages of that workflow, defined in a single file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jenkins is &lt;strong>recommended by expensive consultants&lt;/strong>. In a large enterprise that&amp;rsquo;s important. If you go with a tool that the high-powered consultants don&amp;rsquo;t put on a &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s what people are doing&amp;rdquo; list, you end up fighting an uphill battle. Choose those battles wisely; you&amp;rsquo;ll likely lose them unless you have a &lt;em>very&lt;/em> compelling use case.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So now that we&amp;rsquo;ve decided on Jenkins as our CI of choice, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how we would implement that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="jenkinsfile-example">Jenkinsfile Example&lt;/h1>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can see here that the &lt;code>Jenkinsfile&lt;/code> is acting more like an integration point to the &lt;code>rakefile&lt;/code>. That&amp;rsquo;s how we like it; we want as much as possible to be reproducible locally. Then we walk through the stages and do the things. Here is a more detailed explanation of the stages:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Stage&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Lint&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Checks that the code meets our guidelines&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Unit Test&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Runs chef unit tests on the cookbook, if any exist&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Functional (Kitchen)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Runs test kitchen against all suites&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Promote to Supermarket&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Promotes the cookbook to an internal supermarket&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>This provides a very simple way for cookbooks to go from a checkin to the supermarket.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-this-up-in-jenkins">Setting this up in Jenkins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In Jenkins we create two builds:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A &lt;a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/">pipeline&lt;/a> build that builds off of &lt;code>master&lt;/code>. Notice that we &lt;strong>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/strong> use the multi-branch pipeline build at the moment, because we were having quality issues with that feature in Jenkins and wanted to test our pull requests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Stash+pullrequest+builder+plugin">pull request&lt;/a> builder that tests pull requests in our local &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket">bitbucket&lt;/a> server.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The pull requests inside of bitbucket are set to not allow acceptance without a passing build, so this keeps our &lt;code>master&lt;/code> branch clean and ready to go. Just in case, the &lt;code>master&lt;/code> build will build everything before sending the cookbook off to the supermarket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll also notice that the &lt;code>Jenkinsfile&lt;/code> has a lot of &lt;code>try/catch&lt;/code> logic in it. This is so the &lt;code>Jenkinsfile&lt;/code> can notify the pull request verifier that a build failed, and that message will show up inside of the pull request. So you get some complexity here, but great benefit with having nice integration with your pull request workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once pull requests are solid, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to lock down your master branch. Don&amp;rsquo;t let a lot of people commit directly to it; instead have them submit pull requests. This follows the normal open source model that products like Chef use, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find that it works very well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>With a solid cookbook build in place and a CI process, things start to get regularly tested and quality goes up. I had to be persuaded by my colleagues to go the pull request verifier route, but now that I have, I see what they were trying to tell me: pull requests get tested, master is solid, and your speed of delivery goes up. Maybe one day the Jenkins blue ocean project will catch up to Bitbucket integration, but until then, this works pretty nice for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to also thank and credit my colleagues &lt;a href="http://kerryhouse.net/">John Kerry&lt;/a> and Richard Godbee for leading me in this direction. They spent a ton of time helping me understand how to make a good workflow in Jenkins, and the outline above would not be possible if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for their help.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cookbook Development with Rakefiles</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-development-with-rakefile/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-development-with-rakefile/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-cookbook-development-with-rakefile.jpg" alt="Cookbook Development Rakefile" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When we &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/">started Chef&lt;/a>, we had a loose set of rules for everyone to follow and sent them on their way. We quickly realized, however, that we needed to standardize how a cookbook met quality standards before it got released. We would try to make a simple change to a cookbook and it didn&amp;rsquo;t meet our coding standards. Or they forgot to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/">introduce kitchen&lt;/a>. Or they remembered but they didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything when their kitchen broke three weeks ago. It was chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Essentially our cookbooks are like any other code product: they need a build process, automated testing, and a way to release them to the outside world. Without that, you&amp;rsquo;ll have chaos and doom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best way I know of to do this is with &lt;code>rake&lt;/code> (see &lt;a href="https://github.com/mhedgpeth/cafe-cookbook/blob/master/Rakefile">this example&lt;/a> on my &lt;code>cafe&lt;/code> cookbook).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>rake&lt;/code> has several advantages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s all in one file, using a common framework that other Ruby developers use&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It easily integrates within a chef environment using the &lt;code>chef exec&lt;/code> commands&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It integrates well into any existing pipeline or CI server&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Its one disadvantage is that it can be difficult for non-ruby developers to understand, &lt;em>however&lt;/em>, the benefits above far outweighs this advantage. We&amp;rsquo;ve found that with the simple &lt;code>rakefile&lt;/code> below, most people don&amp;rsquo;t even have to touch their rakefile and can just use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use the same &lt;code>rakefile&lt;/code> for every cookbook, located in the base folder of the cookbook in a dedicated git repository for that cookbook. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">task &lt;span style="color:#990073">default&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#990073">:clean&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#990073">:style&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#990073">:test&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;ve said before, you don&amp;rsquo;t really need to be able to understand every line of this &lt;code>rakefile&lt;/code> in order to make good use of it. So let&amp;rsquo;s get up to speed on that part:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup">Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before running the &lt;code>rakefile&lt;/code> you&amp;rsquo;ll need to set up some gems:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>chef gem install stove bump
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>These gems are used for uploading to a supermarket and bumping a version, respectively. More on that below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="running-locally">Running Locally&lt;/h2>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Function&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Command&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Lint&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Ensures that code meets standards&lt;/td>
&lt;td>chef exec rake -t style&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Test&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Ensures that code runs and is ready to go&lt;/td>
&lt;td>chef exec rake -t test&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>We run our &lt;code>rake&lt;/code> within the chef ruby environment, so we prepend it with &lt;code>chef exec&lt;/code> which says &amp;ldquo;run this with chef&amp;rsquo;s built-in ruby&amp;rdquo;. That makes everything much more consistent and easy, especially considering we&amp;rsquo;re using cookstyle and kitchen gems here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To run your linting, just run &lt;code>chef exec rake -t style&lt;/code>. This will run &lt;strong>both&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://github.com/chef/cookstyle">cookstyle&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/">foodcritic&lt;/a> on your cookbooks. We&amp;rsquo;ve found both linting tools to be helpful. Cookstyle is an more sane wrapper around rubocop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another great pro tip on using &lt;code>cookstyle&lt;/code> is that you can automatically fix easy to fix errors by running &lt;code>cookstyle -a&lt;/code>. That saves a ton of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you get past the linting phase, you can run unit tests and kitchen with &lt;code>chef exec rake -t test&lt;/code>. We consider &lt;a href="http://kitchen.ci/">test kitchen&lt;/a> to be an &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/">absolutely critical&lt;/a> aspect of our coding process. Would you ever write code that you never ran before deploying it somewhere? If you&amp;rsquo;re not using test kitchen, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what you&amp;rsquo;re doing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This &lt;code>rakefile&lt;/code> will also allow you to bump your versions automatically (&lt;code>release:bump:patch&lt;/code>) and upload to a supermarket (&lt;code>release:publish&lt;/code>). You&amp;rsquo;ll need the &lt;code>stove&lt;/code> and &lt;code>bump&lt;/code> gems installed with &lt;code>chef gem install stove bump&lt;/code>. Also you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add a &lt;code>.stove&lt;/code> file to house the configuration of how to talk to the supermarket, with these contents:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;username&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;yourusernametosupermarket&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;key&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;C:/Users/yourusername/.chef/yourusername.pem&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;no-git&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;true&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;endpoint&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;https://supermarket.yourcompany.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The bump and publish targets should be reserved for your CI agent most of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="running-with-ci">Running with CI&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you run this with a CI server, you&amp;rsquo;ll need set the &lt;code>CI&lt;/code> environment variable to &lt;code>true&lt;/code> so your tests will report the &amp;ldquo;CI&amp;rdquo; way. Then simply run the targets as you need. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a version of our &lt;code>Jenkinsfile&lt;/code> in the next post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-not-delivery-though">Why not Delivery though?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My friend Matt Stratton &lt;a href="https://www.mattstratton.com/post/getting-started-with-chef/">suggests&lt;/a> using Chef Delivery cookbooks to do this same thing. We didn&amp;rsquo;t go in this direction for a few reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ignorance&lt;/strong>: we don&amp;rsquo;t know delivery very well and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a community around it that can get a local build up and running quickly. Most of delivery seems to be centered around getting Chef Workflow to work, which is not something we had plans to do.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Training&lt;/strong>: more people know rake than know delivery. So rake is the easier option&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Simplicity&lt;/strong>: while rake does leave you a bit confused as to the particulars of what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, it&amp;rsquo;s all in one file and can be easily run. The delivery stuff is in a hierarchy of folders and therefore takes more to understand.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Having a local cookbook build that is standard in all of our projects has become essential to our implementation of Chef at scale. I think the &lt;code>Rakefile&lt;/code> I use above is an excellent choice for standardizing in a way that is both flexible and simple.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DevOps Leadership Summit in Dallas</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/devops-leadership-summit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/devops-leadership-summit/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>Last year when we organized the first DevOps Days DFW, many attendees told us that they thought the content was fantastic, but that they wished they could have something that they could invite their leadership team to. Since &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/finding-alignment/">alignment&lt;/a> is so critical to changing anything in a large organization, the DevOps Days DFW Organizers agree and are pleased to announce a &lt;strong>DevOps Leadership Summit&lt;/strong> on Monday, August 28, 2017 from 8:00 to 1:30 at the &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GSqXneQtXAL2">Capital One Plano Conference Center&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to have &lt;a href="http://nicolefv.com/">Nicole Forsgren&lt;/a> of DORA, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamjacob/">Adam Jacob&lt;/a> from Chef Software, and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnwillisatlanta/">John Willis&lt;/a> from Docker join us for the event. We will have a couple of talks, a workshop, and an interactive networking lunch where attendees can interact directly with our speakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attendance to the event is limited to 50 people and is by invitation only through nominations. The ideal attendee is a Director, VP, or C-level executive who is or is interested in facilitating a DevOps transformation in his or her company. To nominate yourself or someone else, let us know how this person fits that criteria via email: &lt;a href="mailto:organizers-dallas-2017@devopsdays.org">organizers-dallas-2017@devopsdays.org&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cost of the event is covered by a ticket to DevOps Days DFW 2017, which can be purchased &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/devopsdays-dfw-2017-tickets-33482024637">here&lt;/a>. We don&amp;rsquo;t expect everyone attending the Leadership event to attend the entire DevOps Days. In fact, it would be just fine if they came to the keynotes in the morning and that&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you know anyone who would benefit from coming to our Leadership Summit, please let us know!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Which Line?</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/which-line/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/which-line/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I started my career as a developer at a worker&amp;rsquo;s compensation case management company. We wrote software that nurses, who were employees, used to manage worker&amp;rsquo;s compensation cases in hopes that we would get people back to work quicker and thus lower costs. I had a talented and opinionated boss who gave me a lot of room to learn and grow. It was a great first job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a couple of years, however, it became clear that the software I was working on wasn&amp;rsquo;t seen as increasing the revenue of the company but decreasing its costs. Within this business model, the key &lt;em>operational&lt;/em> revenue was coming from the nurses who were managing the cases. I was making the nurses more efficient, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>directly&lt;/em> contributing to revenue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In business terms, I was not contributing to the &lt;em>top line&lt;/em>, I was contributing to the &lt;em>bottom line&lt;/em>. For those of us who don&amp;rsquo;t handle P&amp;amp;L every day, here&amp;rsquo;s what that means:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Insurance Companies pay for Case Management (Revenue) - TOP LINE
SUBTRACT Cost of Nurses to Manage Cases (Cost)
MY SOFTWARE Lowers the Amount of Nurses We need (Lower Cost)
Company Investors get money left over (Profit) - BOTTOM LINE
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>So in this job, I was contributing to the bottom line by lowering the cost of operating the business. This is wonderful, but I quickly realized the downsides to this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is a ceiling to the financial impact I can have to the company&lt;/strong>. Within this model, I can only add value to the level that the operations cost. And the further down the road I get, the less efficiency I can extract out of this system. For example, if in the first year it costs $5M to run this group and I make software changes that mean we only need to spend $4M on nurses, I made a great impact. But in the next year, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to&amp;hellip;reduce costs by another $1M? At some point the efficiency runs against the core business model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The rewards are going to the top line&lt;/strong>. Who are the people getting the large bonuses and promotions? The people who are closest to the top line revenue. That is an unfair fact of business but a very real one. So I saw myself with fewer options than my peers within other business models. I&amp;rsquo;ve often wondered why this is, and the closest I can get to is the previous reason: if you have a rockstar sales person, they could &lt;strong>create&lt;/strong> millions of dollars of revenue for the company by creating a new deal. For those dealing with the bottom line, the upside is limited to costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I quickly came the conclusion that I wanted to work at a software company and got a job at Radiant Systems (which later was aquired by NCR). At NCR there is a different equation:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Restaurants pay for MY SOFTWARE (Revenue) - TOP LINE
SUBTRACT cost of support, services, operations
Company investors get money left over (Profit) - BOTTOM LINE
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Within this model, my software is what the company is selling. This changes everything. The upside to my work is unlimited. If I work with sales to get a feature in the software, that could move the needle tremendously for the company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For years I enjoyed the career benefits to being aligned with revenue at a business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then I moved to a DevOps role.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A strange thing happened at that point. In people&amp;rsquo;s minds, I was &lt;em>moved&lt;/em> into the cost side of the business. Therefore, I was making the cost of the business more efficient but also was missing out on the upside. In the revenue-aligned positions that I enjoyed in the past, I was rewarded for innovation because that meant there would be upside. But in the operations world, I fought a perception that innovation would disrupt the efficiencies already gained and take us (and our careers) backwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my mind, DevOps is the biggest revenue driver opportunity that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. If we can find a way to ship ideas and features more quickly, then by definition our revenue will increase. It&amp;rsquo;s a force multiplier for development. However, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that most businesses out there will not see it this way. Most businesses see DevOps through an efficiency lens, because efficiency is all IT Operations has been about since it began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last night a friend of mine was talking about this with me, and he said that he worked a DevOps job for six months writing Chef scripts, getting paid well, for an application with few to no users. He ended up having very little financial impact on that company. Then he pivoted to a development role where he increased his company&amp;rsquo;s revenue by 1/3 in a year. In the latter role, he used DevOps principles to create a CD pipeline, etc., but he also developed the capability to fundamentally change his business. What an exciting story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s interesting to consider though: let&amp;rsquo;s say I split my friend up into the rockstar Developer and rockstar DevOps person. They work together to create this same outcome. At the end of the day, who will the company reward and nurture more? I&amp;rsquo;m thinking the Developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If that&amp;rsquo;s the case, then those of us headed down the pure DevOps path might want to consider the limitations we are imposing on ourselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would love to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Habitat?</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/why-habitat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/why-habitat/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-finding-habitat.jpg" alt="Why Habitat?" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I started my career as a software engineer, and I always love creating a new application and seeing the magic of that application being deployed to production. I love seeing the excitement on our user&amp;rsquo;s faces when we talk about all the cool stuff we&amp;rsquo;re working on. And I love making that &lt;em>real&lt;/em> for people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve become increasingly aware of the gulf that exists between making something real on my own machine as a developer and making something real for a user of my software who is experiencing an ROI for my work. That frustration led me to tackle the problem of how to better deploy an application into production. I&amp;rsquo;ve found &lt;a href="https://www.habitat.sh/">Habitat&lt;/a> to be a compelling but often misunderstood new option within this space. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the pros and cons of other application deployment technologies and then at the end talk about what makes me so excited about Habitat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the various approaches to application automation, from the simplest to the most complex:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scripted">Scripted&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the past when we created new applications, most of us did an initial demo or deployment by running through a list of items someone needs to do to run an application in an environment that a developer didn&amp;rsquo;t build. There are files to be copied somewhere, commands to run, and validation to ensure that the application is running. In our starting scenario, people do this work manually or with custom built scripts, which become more and more complex over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with the &amp;ldquo;manual&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;scripted&amp;rdquo; way is that solutions end up being bespoke per application, and thus poorly maintainable. There also isn&amp;rsquo;t a really great way to know whether the script was successful. Many scripting languages will just return a code in the middle, leave the system in an unhealthy state, and just kind of shrug when failures occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you usually won&amp;rsquo;t do the scripted way in &lt;em>all&lt;/em> environments; just your production environment. This will create unintended surprises that lead to more brittle deployments and longer lead times to get deployments out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re using a manual or bash/powershell scripted way to deploy applications, I highly recommend you consider a better mechanism defined below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="packaged">Packaged&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The next obvious solution to this problem of how to get your application in production is to package the application and its files with scripts that will deploy it. This is what we considered when we evaluated &lt;a href="https://xebialabs.com/products/xl-deploy/">XL Deploy&lt;/a>. Also, in a windows-only world one could use &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey&lt;/a> for this purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These tools really shine when deployment of a package is relatively simple and isolated. I love and use Chocolatey for third party applications, like installing ChefDK or even chrome on a new machine. The package mechanism also allows you to promote a single package through multiple environments, thus ensuring that you have better quality when you go to production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The packaged mechanism is almost always a better model than the pure scripted mechanism mentioned above. However, we decided not to go with this way to deploy applications because we wanted a more holistic model for how to manage the &lt;em>entire&lt;/em> machine that the application needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, if we had an IIS machine, it&amp;rsquo;s just as important that IIS is set up properly as it is that the website files exist with a IIS website set up. If we ignore the former, there is no value in the latter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So for complex applications, I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend using a packaged mechanism for application deployment. I do recommend using the packaged mechanism for third party applications (and on windows, use Chocolatey), but limit its usage to isolated third party applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="configuration-management">Configuration Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Up until recently, if one were to want to take a more holistic approach to application deployment automation, the best choice was to use a configuration management tool like &lt;a href="https://www.chef.io/">Chef&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has several advantages. First, with Chef you get a holistic machine level environment within which your application will run. So with our IIS example, you get a &lt;em>configured&lt;/em> IIS Server there upon which your application will run. You can use &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/">Test Kitchen&lt;/a> to ensure that the entire machine will run, so you have a much better ability to test that your deployment code works early in the process. And integration testing with other third party applications is natural as well; if you have a problem with running an APM or Security tool with your application, you&amp;rsquo;ll find those problems more easily while using a configuration management approach to application automation, because you&amp;rsquo;ll more naturally be able to include all the machine dependencies into a coded, trackable artifact like a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">Policyfile&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is ultimately the path we took two and a half years ago, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad we did. The holistic approach has proven to be more difficult to execute than a simple scripted or package-based mechanism, but it also gives us consistency, which gives us higher uptime and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/our-superbowl/">ability to scale&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach has its drawbacks. First, it has been difficult to get our developers and QA staff to really embrace Chef for &lt;em>their&lt;/em> environments. They can&amp;rsquo;t just take a &amp;ldquo;chef&amp;rdquo; package and &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; it on a developer or QA machine for feature testing. They probably need an entire separate machine there. And they probably want it to be connected to a Chef Server. All of this overhead makes it difficult or impossible for a developer to want to use the chef deployment mechanism locally. When we get to a shared, stable QA environment or UAT environment, it&amp;rsquo;s fine. But for a QA person trying to test an app on a private local machine, Chef isn&amp;rsquo;t a very good natural choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second drawback to this approach is the distinct difference that exists between a promise-based configuration management system&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and the workflow-oriented approach that exists in a typical deployment. With deployment you&amp;rsquo;re talking about steps, like &amp;ldquo;first I upgrade the database, then I update the files, then I turn the websites on and add them back to the LB&amp;rdquo;. A &amp;ldquo;desired state&amp;rdquo; DSL like Chef, Puppet, or DSC is not a very natural way to express this. We&amp;rsquo;ve gotten around it with Chef and can get by, but the unnatural expression of workflow within a promise-based DSL has slowed down our adoption of Chef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, if I&amp;rsquo;m doing a workflow based deployment, it looks something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1. Stop all services
2. Upgrade database
3. Copy files to the right locations
4. Start all services
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s relatively simple, and how most people think of an orchestrated deployment. With Chef, however, it becomes quite difficult (and this is only on one machine):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>1. download the artifact file, notify 2, 3, 4 to run
2. service action: stopped (only if notified)
3. execute script 'upgrade database' (only if notified)
4. copy all files (only if notified)
5. service action: started (every time)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t know Chef, you&amp;rsquo;re probably thoroughly confused, and that&amp;rsquo;s the point. Chef is just not very good at executing a workflow like this. You might say that Ansible or Puppet Orchestration are better at it, but the reality is that you&amp;rsquo;re still using a promise language to express a workflow problem. You&amp;rsquo;ve found a hammer and now you think everything is a nail. Is there a better way? Perhaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="containers">Containers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A lot of people I meet view Docker as a lightweight virtual machine runtime mechanism. They think that Docker&amp;rsquo;s main benefits are faster uptime and lower resource consumption. Recently &lt;a href="http://www.weshigbee.com/">Wes Higbee&lt;/a> helped me understand the true benefits of Docker and how they relate to application deployment automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Docker, at the surface, allows you to have the best of both worlds between packaging and configuration management above. You can create a Docker container that &lt;em>contains&lt;/em> all of the dependencies that the application needs to run into a container, and then ship that container to run on any linux environment you want. So you now have a single file, that is itself &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a script, it&amp;rsquo;s a package that is &lt;em>immediately&lt;/em> ready to run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This changes everything. I no longer have to worry that IIS is set up incorrectly. If I&amp;rsquo;m using a Docker container for Windows, I can use the &lt;code>microsoft\iis&lt;/code> image and build on top of it to create a fully encapsulated running application that can run on any Windows Server 2016 host.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, I get a more lightweight runtime so I can take this image and very rapidly autoscale during peak consumption times. So in the past, I had to spin up a new server, and even if it was fully automated, I would have to wait a few minutes for that to be built. With Docker, I can have that server up in seconds, consuming less resources and therefore operating at a fraction of the cost, and then kill the server when the peak consumption time is over. Usually I&amp;rsquo;ll run a scheduler like &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://www.openshift.com">Open Shift&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://mesosphere.com/">Mesosphere&lt;/a> to &amp;ldquo;schedule&amp;rdquo; when machines are going in and out of operations and how upgrades occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you fully grasp what containers can bring to the table for application runtime isolation and scale, it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get caught up in the excitement of what the future can bring. However, as I think about it more, my excitement has been tempered a bit. Containers are a powerful tool that can do both great good and great harm to your business. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a few risks:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, scheduled containers as mentioned above rely on an immutable infrastructure to work. In other words, if you are used to logging into a machine to look at anything, or making any manual changes at all, you&amp;rsquo;re not ready for containers. I often say to people that Packaging/Scripting is like playing Junior Varsity football, Configuration Management is like playing College Football, and Containers are like the NFL. If you&amp;rsquo;re still in JV football, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get very far with the NFL equivalent. Yes, other companies have done it. But those companies also don&amp;rsquo;t ssh into their servers to make changes. Do you? If so you&amp;rsquo;re not ready for this. Work on becoming more mature in your processes, and then revisit it perhaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A second problem with this containers approach, is that you end up isolating the application itself, which is wonderful, but you replace that isolation with an essential &lt;em>scheduler&lt;/em> component that is itself complicated and therefore prone to error. In other words, your developer may say &amp;ldquo;hey, my docker image works, what&amp;rsquo;s the problem?&amp;rdquo; and at that level there is no problem. But at the scheduler level, there might be an orchestration problem, or runtime problem. You solved your isolation problem, in effect, by replacing it with another tool that few people understand and that developers are likely not going to run themselves. Instead of having the desired effect of making deployment &lt;em>simpler&lt;/em>, it actually makes deployment more difficult, by introducing a runtime environment that allows little interactivity and troubleshooting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final problem I have with containers is the latent issues of including a full stack of linux in the container image itself. I get this warning from &lt;a href="http://www.juliandunn.net/2015/12/04/the-oncoming-train-of-enterprise-container-deployments/">Julian Dunn&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a>. Julian has some great points, and if you have time, read his post on the topic. The risk here is that if you include the current version of ubuntu in your docker image, and that version has security vulnerabilities inside of it that are discovered a decade from now, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be difficult to change/update those images. In Docker, an image is immutable, so you need to have a pipeline to build a new image set up if you&amp;rsquo;re doing it right. Which leads to the question: are your Docker images in production built within a continuous delivery pipeline? Are you prepared for that pipeline to be fully functional for the container&amp;rsquo;s lifespan, which could span decades? For most enterprises I&amp;rsquo;ve interacted with, it would be a huge step to go from where they are to a fully functional and operational CD pipeline. And on the startup side, do we &lt;em>really&lt;/em> trust that they will take the time to deploy docker in an immutable rebuildable way using a minimal image? I think that&amp;rsquo;s wishful thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, containers provide a fantastic platform for isolation of our application and for scaling it. But when you try to &lt;em>operationalize&lt;/em> the application, the complexity increases to the point that it becomes nearly impossible to pull it off without making serious ommissions that are going to bite you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is there a better way? It looks like my friends at Chef have something that is quite intriguing:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="habitat">Habitat&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last Summer, &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/finding-habitat/">Chef released Habitat&lt;/a> as their application automation platform. Habitat is different in many ways to the previous categories, so much so that it deserves its own category.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With habitat, I can script the build and execution of my application in a way that I would if I were just scripting it from scratch. But, unlike with the typical scripting mechanism, the scripting is &lt;em>build into the application&lt;/em> package itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So Habitat is a package? Well it&amp;rsquo;s similar to that, yes. Habitat allows you to have a single file that represents the package. So I can provide QA the application and they can run it very quickly. Or as a developer I can run my application locally or on a container very easily. But unlike the packaging mechanisms listed above in the classic model, Habitat will isolate the package&amp;rsquo;s dependencies in order to give me the assurance that my application will run on any environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I have that packaged deployment mechanism, I no longer need to fit the square peg (application deployment) into a round hole (configuration management). Instead, configuration management can do the things it is good at: making sure the machines on which your applications run are hardened and configured correctly. With the application deployment out of the configuration management code, the complexity drastically reduces and therefore the velocity of adoption drastically increases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally, Habitat will help you operationalize containers with a lot less complexity. It does this in two ways: First inside of its package is a &lt;em>contract&lt;/em> with other applications that will help fulfill the real-time configuration needs of a rapidly changing environment. For example, if I&amp;rsquo;m upgrading an application, I may need that application to be taken out of the load balancer, or I may need for that application to talk to a database. That sounds easy in a classic model where these things may change only occasionally, but in a containerized world, these things change within seconds. Habitat helps you manage the relationships within your applications and therefore allows you to truly operationalize microservices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also easy to take this package and run it as a developer in a simpler model. This is the genius of packaging these services with the app: you no longer have to deal with the complexity of a scheduler, or &lt;em>something else&lt;/em> that is there. Developers never like to have to throw the kitchen sink at something to just run something. They want to run something simple and get a production-like result. Habitat is the closest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve seen to achieving this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second thing Habitat does to lower complexity for containers is that it builds an application and all of its dependencies from scratch. This provides the isolation needed to truly make the package portable, but it also provides a declared understanding of &lt;em>what&lt;/em> an application&amp;rsquo;s dependencies are. So if there is a vulnerability in one of the dependencies, it&amp;rsquo;s as easy as querying for that dependency, and then easily rebuilding that application with the newer dependency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the lower complexity for deploying applications, it&amp;rsquo;s also quite easy to increase the maturity of an application&amp;rsquo;s runtime &lt;em>without&lt;/em> having to resort to using Docker and a scheduler. This way an organization can have a more gradual strategy for taking advantage of application isolation and increase the cultural and procedural maturity needed to pull them off safely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the reasons laid out in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve become a fan of Habitat in the past six weeks that I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at it. Habitat has a shot at changing the game for application development and delivering on the promise and profitability of Continuous Delivery of our applications. However, there are currently some drawbacks one should be aware of before going down this route. First, Habitat is in its early stages. While I would be fine with putting this into production (in fact I&amp;rsquo;m days away from doing so), the tooling is not as mature as one experiences with Docker. Therefore, an adopter will need to rely on their fantastic slack channel to get up to speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second negative to Habitat that I&amp;rsquo;ll call out is the learning curve, due to its bash-centric authoring model. There are a few abstractions I miss within Habitat. For example, when I&amp;rsquo;m telling Habitat where to find the source, I want to just give it the answer (for example, from GitHub). Instead I have to create a shell script to do some things that are not quite straightforward. Also, when I want to build an application, I want to tell it &amp;ldquo;build a node application from &lt;em>this&lt;/em> source directory&amp;rdquo;. Instead I need to copy/paste a bash script I didn&amp;rsquo;t write and change the &lt;em>right&lt;/em> things within that script. I&amp;rsquo;m told by the product team that this will be addressed within an upcoming &lt;a href="https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/issues/1951">blueprints feature&lt;/a>. When this feature is delivered, I will probably go from cautiously recommending it to wholeheartedly recommending it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The final negative to Habitat, for the next few weeks hopefully, is that there is little Windows support. Many of our applications rely on Windows to run, so our value of this platform will greatly increase when that is delivered.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many approaches to application deployment automation: Scripting, Packaging, Configuration Management, Containers, and Habitat. Of them all, I believe Habitat has the greatest chance at delivering a scalable, cloud-ready, and operational application deployment mechanism that can truly realize the promise and ROI of DevOps for application developers. I highly encourage those of you interested in this topic to being following the project and contributing with feedback and implementations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There may be a time in the future where Chef is known more for Habitat and InSpec than for Chef, just as Apple is known more for their iPhone and iPad than their Mac. If the Habitat team delivers on the transformative vision they&amp;rsquo;ve laid out, that day will come very soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Policyfiles Update</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles-update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles-update/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-policyfiles-update.jpg" alt="Policyfiles Update" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I wanted to share with you some great news &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">about policyfiles&lt;/a> and let you know what I&amp;rsquo;ll be up to on this blog over the next couple of months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past six months or so, the Chef product team and I have been working together to map out our partnership. In the early days, their support and coaching &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/technology-partnership/">were absolutely essential&lt;/a>, but as we&amp;rsquo;ve matured, their &lt;a href="https://www.chef.io/automate/">Chef Automate&lt;/a> product has become an essential element of operationalizing Chef at scale within our large organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was clear to me after our extensive initial discussions at Chef Community Summit in October that we weren&amp;rsquo;t going to be able to abandon Policyfiles at NCR. The change management guarantees that Policyfiles give us are too central to our approach to automation with safety. Also, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to go back and train everyone on a different and more complicated way. And finally, I could see from the highly attended and engaged open space we did on Policyfiles that this topic resonated with users. I then decided to do what I could do to help Policyfiles gain traction as a feature and then try to work with Chef to see what we could do in their product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In January, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trevorghess">Trevor Hess&lt;/a> became our Customer Architect and we began working in earnest toward a solution for how to move forward. Trevor relied on his consulting experience to drill down to the essential elements of the solution and find the people that could help us. This led to Chef doing some research of their own to find out that this investment would indeed address a market need that has emerged within the last few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;m happy to let you all know that Chef&amp;rsquo;s Product team has confirmed that viewing and filtering on Policyfile data in Chef Automate has made it onto the roadmap for this year. Over the next week or so we&amp;rsquo;ll be working on getting Policyfile data from the Chef Server to a Kibana report that others who use Policyfiles can take advantage of as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The future of Automate is quite bright, and we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to be a part of it going forward. Their investment in product management and UX is paying off tremendously. This is not the product I started with in 2014; it&amp;rsquo;s got a vision, team, and experience that is going to take Chef where it wants to go in the enterprise. I&amp;rsquo;m so happy that Policyfile users will get to take part of all that goodness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In May &lt;a href="http://sched.co/9vZD">I&amp;rsquo;m going to speak at ChefConf&lt;/a> on Policyfiles. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;m going to blog in detail about my approach to Policyfiles and Chef overall, in hopes that it will begin a movement among the Chef community to simplify the approach and thus broaden the adoption of Chef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, if you have any questions about Policyfiles, a few of us are active in the #policyfiles channel on the &lt;a href="http://community-slack.chef.io/">Chef Community Slack&lt;/a>. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our Superbowl</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/our-superbowl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/our-superbowl/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-our-superbowl.jpg" alt="Our Superbowl" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In the summer of 2014, I became convinced that NCR needed a more agile and consistent delivery process to safely enable our customers to grow their businesses beyond the four walls of the restaurant and into the new opportunities presented by mobile first consumers. While I was &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">no stranger to continuous integration&lt;/a> and a testable pipeline for releases (what I was pleased to learn people call DevOps), I realized that our customers were not going to feel the full power of our investment into their success until we created a safe, repeatable, rapidly executable pipeline to transfer that value to them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember meeting with multiple people inside and outside of NCR who counseled me to get closer to our revenue and away from the &amp;ldquo;cost&amp;rdquo; focused operations space. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t let go of my intuition; if our customers weren&amp;rsquo;t realizing the true value of our development, then those investments are by definition worthless! So I &lt;em>had&lt;/em> to dive into this opportunity and work to change the game for our customers and NCR&amp;rsquo;s future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That future became the present just a few short weeks ago on a Sunday evening. A key customer wanted to go all-in with an online ordering promotion for the Super Bowl this Sunday. They demanded capacity from us that went beyond our ability to provide by just adding a few more machines. We decided to best serve this customer and all of our customers that we were going to build another production environment from the ground up on one of our most complicated but strategically important SaaS products.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I started this journey, this would have been an unthinkable level of risk. But since our forward thinking leadership invested in our partnership with Chef, the new environment was provisioned in a fraction of the time that we expected, and with full safety and consistency that we needed to be confident that we could meet our targets. When our customer did stress tests, the product team was able to quickly react to any issues and we had the confidence that we were going to increase stability through rapid change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At one point on Sunday evening, we ran into a snag with our deployment. We had a problem with Chef that would have blocked us from moving forward. I got on slack and asked a member of my customer success team, Thomas Cate, for help. He directed me to customer support. &lt;strong>Within ten minutes of filing the issue, Zach Zondlo, on a Sunday evening at 8PM Central Time, responded and got on our conference bridge to help us out.&lt;/strong> The problem was resolved in ten minutes. That experience alone was a mic drop moment for our partnership with Chef. The people at Chef know how important operations is and culturally assign the priority and dedication that high severity situations warrant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we approach the big day on Sunday with a customer who will grow their revenue in a way they couldn&amp;rsquo;t have imagined just a few short years ago, I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of how my our partnership with Chef has meant to NCR and to me personally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of the early days when Matt Stratton believed that we could do this, even when I wondered how we were going to get everyone on board with such an ambitious and forward thinking plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of the patient and understanding ear Justin Redd gave me as he walked me through the difficult and frustrating early days where I had to get so much operational alignment from so many people in order to make Chef a reality in production. Justin never came to me with a formula. He and his team listened, and helped us down a path that was &lt;strong>good for us first&lt;/strong>. They knew if we succeeded they would succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of my newfound respect for sales and my long strategic conversations with Brittany Shaeffer. Brittany has helped me realize that value needs connection to be realized. So many times those of us with an engineering background think that technical outcomes will just stand on their own merits to the business. The sales organization at Chef does a phenomenal job at helping me make that value a reality for all stakeholders, so the business can provide the fuel necessary achieve a high velocity delivery model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of my friend Nathen Harvey who welcomed this BigCorp Texan into a world in which I felt more than a little out of place. I was only months into my Chef journey and for some reason submitted a talk to ChefConf that was accepted. By the time I got there I was completely convinced that I didn&amp;rsquo;t belong there. Nathen personally welcomed me into the Chef Community and showed me that I belonged there. I found this spirit of acceptance and inclusion so compelling that I felt safe enough to introduce &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">my wife Annie&lt;/a> into it. And the community has shown a tremendous amount of &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com/leaning-in">respect and support&lt;/a> to Annie which has already had a profound affect on our future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so happy to have gotten to this milestone in our partnership with Chef. I&amp;rsquo;m so happy to have leadership that believed in the vision and gave me the freedom and resources to execute that vision. I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to know so many people within NCR that were able to take a chance and believe in what we were trying to accomplish. It truly takes a village to get anything done in a large organization, and I&amp;rsquo;m fortunate to be a part of a great one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our partnership with Chef is only beginning. As we scale our solution to use Chef Automate, secure our expansion with Compliance, and add even more of our product suites to Chef, we&amp;rsquo;re confident that the best is yet to come!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing Cafe</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/introducing-cafe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/introducing-cafe/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-introducing-cafe.jpg" alt="Introducing Cafe" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I was fortuntate enough to be at Chef Summit in Seattle last November and learned two very valuable things there: First, I learned that the core power of Chef is in its community and ecosystem. Within this ecosystem we can depart from the user customer/vendor relationship where you&amp;rsquo;re at the mercy of a product team and may or may not have enough sway to get your stuff done. Instead you can work with the community to contribute your own stuff. This inspired me to be a contributor instead of just a taker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second thing I learned was that the Microsoft ecosystem was alive and well, but had a really hard time getting Chef to run in a consistent way on Windows. So I decided to do something about that over my holidays and a few long nights, and have come up with a new project I&amp;rsquo;m introducing today: &lt;a href="https://github.com/mhedgpeth/cafe">cafe&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cafe exists to make running Chef in a windows environment easier. It takes my over two years of experience with Chef on Windows and simplifies and streamlines how I think it should go. And fortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m able to rely on my software development background to create a product that will feel like a easy to use, real product to people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you&amp;rsquo;re still reading, and I hope you are, let&amp;rsquo;s go through a demo real quick, or if you&amp;rsquo;re more visual &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxHi01vBkiw">watch my demo on YouTube&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Cafe is a standalone program that is fully operational by unzipping files into a folder and running &lt;code>cafe.exe&lt;/code>. No ruby or .NET dependencies. It just works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To install:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Unzip the installation package into a folder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>cafe init&lt;/code> if you want it added to the path (you&amp;rsquo;ll need to reboot)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>cafe service register&lt;/code> to have the cafe server run in the background so it can do things for you&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="runtime">Runtime&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Cafe is lightweight. To run the service it takes around 20MB of memory and no CPU. This means that you can put cafe on all your nodes, then install and run chef as you want to.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>After installation, let&amp;rsquo;s work on getting chef bootstrapped on the machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step is to download and install &lt;a href="http://inspec.io/">inspec&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe inspec download 1.7.1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Once the inspec installer is downloaded, let&amp;rsquo;s install it:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe inspec install 1.7.1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Next we will do the same with the &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef_client.html">Chef Client&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe chef download 12.16.42
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>And then install it:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe chef install 12.16.42
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve installed Chef, let&amp;rsquo;s bootstrap it. You can do this two ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">The Policyfile&lt;/a> way:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe chef bootstrap policy: webserver group: qa config: C:\Users\mhedg\client.rb validator: C:\Users\mhedg\my-validator.pem
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>The Run List Way:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe chef bootstrap run-list: &amp;quot;[chocolatey::default]&amp;quot; config: C:\Users\mhedg\client.rb validator: C:\Users\mhedg\my-validator.pem
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Both ways ask for a config file that will be your &lt;code>client.rb&lt;/code> on the machine and a validator used to ask the chef server for validation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve bootstrapped Chef, we can run it again on demand if we want to:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe chef run
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>We can even look at the &lt;code>logs&lt;/code> directory and see that we have a rolling log that only has our chef-client runs in it. We can also see specific logging for our client and server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We probably want to schedule Chef to run every 30 minutes or so. To do this we edit our &lt;code>server.json&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;ChefInterval&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#099">1800&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;Port&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#099">59320&lt;/span>
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And restart the cafe service:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe service restart
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>At some point you may even want to pause chef on the node so you can manually check a node&amp;rsquo;s state without fear of Chef changing anything. To do this, run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe chef pause
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>And then when you&amp;rsquo;re ready to rejoin the land of sanity, you can simply run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cafe chef resume
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve spent any time getting chef to run on a Windows infrastructure, you should be pretty excited right now. If that&amp;rsquo;s you, please try it out and let me know how it&amp;rsquo;s going for you. I&amp;rsquo;d like to get a community around cafe to become the standard for how we manage Chef in a windows environment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Funnel</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/funnel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2017 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/funnel/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-funnel.jpg" alt="Funnel" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Years back when &lt;a href="https://www.ncr.com/news/newsroom/news-releases/hospitality/ncr-completes-acquisition-of-radiant-systems">NCR bought Radiant Systems&lt;/a>, there was a lot of talk about a new term I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard until then: &lt;strong>the funnel&lt;/strong>. It took me a few years to understand this concept and how it relates technology change initiatives but NCR&amp;rsquo;s rich history as an effective sales organization was instrumental in gaining that understanding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over a century ago, NCR established itself as a pioneer in defining a sales process for how its products are bought. It had a revolutionary new technology, the cash register, that would massively change businesses who adopted it. At the same time, there were a lot of prospective customers who didn&amp;rsquo;t know how the new technology related to &lt;em>their&lt;/em> needs. NCR created a sales process that brought people into a set of stages that led them to the sale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fast forward to today and it is clear that the commitment to excellence in defining the sales process is alive and well at NCR. I was having lunch with the VP of Hosted Solutions on the sales side a few months back (thanks to Adam Jacob &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/_DEToXsgrPc?t=2041">imploring me to having lunch with my sales people&lt;/a>). My sales friend brought me through the sales process and how it rolls up all the way to the highest levels of leadership at NCR. On that day I got a new appreciation for how results-oriented and well designed our a sales organization is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the next few months, I began thinking about how all of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about sales at NCR has related to what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do. The truth is, if I&amp;rsquo;m really trying to be a change agent in my organization, I&amp;rsquo;m not that far off from those sales people in the early 1900&amp;rsquo;s who were trying to bring the cash register to small retailers. There are a few people who are excited and adopting, a few people who are outright hostile, and a lot in the middle who can and will be persuaded when the time is right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where the funnel concept in sales is important and helpful. In a sales funnel, you have stages of the funnel that demand more and more buy-in and resources from potential customers until they are to the point where they are a paying customer. Whenever I map out a change initiative, I think about the funnel, what the stages are, and which people are in which stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the very center of the funnel is the people who are committed to the change initiative and getting solid and visible benefits from the change. At first there is no one in this place, but you want to see who &lt;em>might&lt;/em> be in there in a few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A little bit out, you have people who are excited, see the benefits of the change, but haven&amp;rsquo;t yet gotten to the place where those benefits can be shown to outweigh the costs. This is a difficult place to be because you&amp;rsquo;re asking these people to spend resources toward an end that is not at all guaranteed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The people in this phase will be different depending on the lifecycle of the initiative. At first, you&amp;rsquo;ll have forward-thinking people who have a highly critical business problem to solve. Toward the end of the change&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle you&amp;rsquo;ll have people who would not have been involved unless there was a long track record of success that they could draw from. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to not judge the people in the latter camp, but to empathize with their needs that stem out of their own unique market forces and commitments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bit further out, there is the part of the funnel where people are curious and happy about the change, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t ready to make the commitment needed for it to be successful. These people are kind of dangerous, because if you spend all your time trying to &amp;ldquo;make&amp;rdquo; people who are interested but can&amp;rsquo;t commit to something, then you&amp;rsquo;ll end up killing your change initiative because you don&amp;rsquo;t have any results. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>absolutely imperative&lt;/em> that before you really engage people with what you&amp;rsquo;re doing you first ensure that they are willing and able to make the investment needed to get to the finish line. Lots of people &lt;em>want&lt;/em> the change but aren&amp;rsquo;t able (for whatever reason) to make it happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there is the group that is difficult to even put in the funnel: those people who are in some way hostile to what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to accomplish. These people are sometimes difficult to spot. A lot of times they&amp;rsquo;ll show up and say something like &amp;ldquo;My boss thinks that your initiative is really cool and she wants me to check it out.&amp;rdquo; That could translate into a number of things. For one, the boss could have wanted a promotion but then was blindsided by this &amp;ldquo;other team&amp;rdquo; that is doing great things and stealing the attention from the results she feels like merits a promotion. So she is sending a detractor into the mix to build a case that maybe the change initiative isn&amp;rsquo;t as great as we think it is. That happens. That&amp;rsquo;s politics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key thing to remember with the final group in the funnel is to not focus your resources on them. That&amp;rsquo;s difficult to do, especially because you don&amp;rsquo;t want to alienate anyone and you want to try to help people make the changes that they need to make. In reality, maybe &amp;ldquo;my boss said&amp;rdquo; person is your next champion of your change initiative. Who knows? Usually with these people I create a small experiment to me see what they&amp;rsquo;re really seeing. It could be as simple as &amp;ldquo;why don&amp;rsquo;t you install ChefDK&amp;rdquo; or as complicated as &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s do a POC on your product&amp;rdquo;. Whatever it is, it should be small enough to not distract me from other more important groups of people further into the funnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope you&amp;rsquo;re able to see how the funnel concept can help you map out how you do a change initiative in an organization. I use it on every change initiative I take on as a guide to (1) knowing how to allocate my limited resources and (2) how to strategically move people through a process to where they adopt and embrace change.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Policyfile Attributes</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-attributes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-attributes/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-policyfile-attributes.jpg" alt="Policyfile Attributes" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When you start with &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/">policyfiles&lt;/a> you quickly fall in love with the simplicity of the workflow and how easy it is to learn and teach. However, you&amp;rsquo;re also faced with an apparent show-stopper to adoption: there are lots of community cookbooks out there that expect certain attributes to be in certain locations. It can be quite confusing; I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s kept a lot of people from adopting the feature. So let&amp;rsquo;s get that one out of the way in this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll take the use cases from easiest to most difficult:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="define-attributes-within-policyfile">Define Attributes within Policyfile&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Many times you&amp;rsquo;ll come across a community cookbook that expects attributes to be defined for it to properly run, like with the &lt;code>apache&lt;/code> cookbook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the behavior of your cookbook doesn&amp;rsquo;t change very often, you can declare those attributes in your &lt;code>Policyfile.rb&lt;/code> if you want to:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># in Policyfile.rb&lt;/span>
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;apache2&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">listen_ports&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;80&amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;443&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span>
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That will get you by for simple situations, but if you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a half a dozen or more policies that use this cookbook, this will get very repetitive, and therefore error prone. My rule is if you repeat yourself more than three times then &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">you need to do something about it&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="define-attributes-within-wrapper-cookbook">Define Attributes within Wrapper Cookbook&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In this case, I would create a wrapper cookbook called &lt;code>mycompany-apache&lt;/code> and define the attributes there. Then I can use that recipe in my runlist for all of my policies.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># in mycompany-apache/attributes/default.rb&lt;/span>
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;apache2&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">listen_ports&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;80&amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;443&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span>
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In fact, as a rule of thumb I generally try to keep attributes out of my policyfiles. It&amp;rsquo;s great for smaller cases, and if you just have a few and are getting started, by all means do it, but it creates an unmaintainable mess if you have a lot of machines that need to run against the same attributes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As time has gone on, I think of Policyfiles as defining &lt;em>what&lt;/em> chef scripts should run on a node and something else to handle the configuration elements that those scripts need.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="define-environment-specific-attributes-in-the-policyfile">Define Environment-specific Attributes in the Policyfile&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>With most if not all attributes now removed from my policyfiles, I come across a good reason to include them again: I need to have environment-specific settings that my cookbooks use. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say that I need to use &lt;code>testdatabase&lt;/code> for my &lt;code>qa&lt;/code> environment and &lt;code>proddatabase&lt;/code> for my &lt;code>production&lt;/code> environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can do this pretty easily with Policyfiles:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># in Policyfile.rb&lt;/span>
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;qa&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;myapplication&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;database&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;testdatabase&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;production&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;myapplication&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;database&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;productiondatabase&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now in my recipe code I can simply write:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># in recipes/default.rb&lt;/span>
database &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> node&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">Chef&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">Config&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>policy_group&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;myapplication&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;database&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This is, frankly, how most of our applications work with Policyfiles. This has been good enough for us and therefore is what we went for. Since then, we&amp;rsquo;ve come across other use cases which cause us to go further:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="define-environment-specfic-attributes-in-the-policyfile-consume-them-as-normal-attributes">Define Environment-specfic Attributes in the Policyfile, Consume Them As Normal Attributes&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>One of the major drawbacks of the previous section is the need to change your code to deal with the &lt;code>policy_group&lt;/code> within the hash to get to your value. This is fine if you&amp;rsquo;re starting from scratch like I did, but that won&amp;rsquo;t work for everyone. Thankfully &lt;a href="https://coderanger.net/">code ranger&lt;/a> and friends created the &lt;a href="https://github.com/poise/poise-hoist">poise-hoist&lt;/a> cookbook, which handles a lot of the translation for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to do this, just add &lt;code>poise_hoist&lt;/code> to the &lt;code>run_list&lt;/code> of your &lt;code>Policyfile.rb&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, assuming you have the structure from the previous section, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get the database without using the &lt;code>policy_group&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># in recipes/default.rb, now using poise_hoist&lt;/span>
database &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> node&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;myapplication&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;database&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you were using environments before and that kept you from using Policyfiles, &lt;strong>you now no longer have any excuse.&lt;/strong> Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right: &lt;strong>you can use Policyfiles without changing a line of code by using the &lt;code>poise_hoist&lt;/code> cookbook!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="define-role-specific-attributes-in-the-policyfile-consume-them-as-normal-attributes">Define Role-specific Attributes in the Policyfile, Consume Them As Normal Attributes&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The same workflow we used above to migrate from environments can be used with our roles as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should first understand that roles don&amp;rsquo;t exist within policyfiles. To accomplish the same end, we use a wrapper cookbook that encapsulates everything we want that role to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example you could have a base role that you want everything to follow by creating a &lt;code>mycompany-platform&lt;/code> cookbook. Its default recipe could be something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># in mycompany-platform/recipes/default.rb&lt;/span>
include_recipe &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;logging_provider::default&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
include_recipe &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;chef-client::default&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In that same cookbook you could also define attributes that control your cookbooks:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># in mycompany-platform/attributes/default.rb&lt;/span>
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;chef-client&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;interval&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#099">3600&lt;/span>
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;logging_provider&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;url&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;http://insanely-expensive.io&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you have some elements that change by environment, use the techniques above to do that: &lt;code>poise-hoist&lt;/code> will merge those elements into the places that your recipes will expect to look. For example, for the above section of code, if you wanted to make it environment specific, you would write:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># in Policyfile.rb&lt;/span>
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;qa&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
chef&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">-&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#990073">client&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">interval&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#099">900&lt;/span>
}
&lt;span style="color:#990073">logging_provider&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">url&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;http://test-cheaply.io&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
}
}
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;production&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
chef&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">-&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#990073">client&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">interval&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#099">3600&lt;/span>
}
&lt;span style="color:#990073">logging_provider&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">url&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;http://insanely-expensive.io&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h1 id="support-lots-of-environments-across-lots-of-policyfiles-with-data-bags">Support Lots of Environments Across Lots of Policyfiles with Data Bags&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The techniques outlined above work well for applications that have a minimal number of roles and environments. For example, we have one application with a web and application tier and three different environments. For that we have our attributes declared in the &lt;code>application-webserver.rb&lt;/code> and &lt;code>application-appserver.rb&lt;/code> policyfiles and then flow those policyfiles through our pipeline from &lt;code>qa&lt;/code> to &lt;code>uat&lt;/code> and finally to &lt;code>production&lt;/code> policy groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This starts to fall apart when you need a lot of roles (or policyfiles) use environment-specific attributes. At first glance you might be tempted to create new policy groups, like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># probably not a good idea&lt;/span>
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;qa&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">my_application&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">database&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;qaserver&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
}
}
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;michael-performance&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">my_application&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">database&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;mhperdb&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
}
}
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;mary-testing&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">my_application&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">database&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;marydb&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll encounter a huge problem right away in that you have to copy and maintain these complex structures across a lot of policyfiles. That&amp;rsquo;s a recipe for something to go very wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, we will offload the attributes definitions here to &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/data_bags.html">data bags&lt;/a>. So we&amp;rsquo;ll have different data bags per environment:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;filename&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;environment_michael-performance.json&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;my_application&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;database&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;mhperdb&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll still keep &lt;code>michael-performance&lt;/code> as the &lt;code>policy_group&lt;/code> for the node, but we&amp;rsquo;ll not define any of the attributes in the Policyfile, but instead define them in the &lt;code>environment_michael-performance&lt;/code> data bag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the application cookbook runs, we can merge what is in the data bag into our node attributes by borrowing what the &lt;a href="https://github.com/poise/poise-hoist/blob/master/lib/poise_hoist.rb#L38">poise-hoist cookbook does&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># I haven&amp;#39;t run this but hopefully you get the idea&lt;/span>
environment &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> data_bag_item(&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;myapplication&amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;environment-&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">#{&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">Chef&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">Config&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>policy_group&lt;span style="color:#d14">}&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;span style="color:#008080">Chef&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">Mixin&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">DeepMerge&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>hash_only_merge!(node&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>role_default, environment)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will, as before, make it so you can have Policyfiles and largely the same code as before because you were able to bring the environment data in from another source and merge it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="multi-dimensional-attributes-with-data-bags-and-policyfiles">Multi-Dimensional Attributes with Data Bags and Policyfiles&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We have a couple of products that take this even further. You might have two dimensions of settings: in America, you one service and in Europe you use another. This is true for all environments, but the environments have their own distinct settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this situation you can create two different types of data bags: &lt;code>environment-uat&lt;/code> but also a &lt;code>american-services&lt;/code> and &lt;code>european-services&lt;/code>. Then you could have nodes know which environment they&amp;rsquo;re in and load the appropriate settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You would have a couple of data bags:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;filename&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;american-services&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;weather&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;american-weather-services.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
}
{
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;filename&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;european-services&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;weather&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;letempsenfrance.fr&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you can merge that in as normal, based on timezone, or whichever element fits your situation:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">service &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#008080">Time&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>now()&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>gmt_offset &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">&amp;lt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#099">0&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">?&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;american&amp;#39;&lt;/span> : &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;european&amp;#39;&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#008080">Chef&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">Mixin&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#008080">DeepMerge&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>hash_only_merge!(node&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>role_default, service_settings)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The long term solution for much of this is to define it within a service discovery product like Consul. But that requires learning and adopting another thing, which will probably slow down getting the wins you&amp;rsquo;ll need early on to be successful. Get what you need to get done here, and then adopt other things that work for you one step at a time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="policyfile-nirvana---infrastructure-versions-decoupled-from-scripts">Policyfile Nirvana - Infrastructure Versions Decoupled from Scripts&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When we start with policyfiles, as with the first few use cases above, we tend to put a lot of information in the policyfiles themselves. As things get more complicated, we start to shy away from that because it creates maintainability problems. I&amp;rsquo;ve grown in my usage of policyfiles to think of &lt;strong>policyfiles as a mechanism for getting the right versions of the chef recipes on the node to simply run them.&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s where they really shine; they&amp;rsquo;re an excellent dependency management/workflow simplification feature. They&amp;rsquo;re NOT going to shine for the other things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when I have a version of a website change and therefore need for my scripts to change the file they&amp;rsquo;re using to load that website onto a webserver, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use the policyfile for that. Instead I can use the &lt;em>same&lt;/em> policyfile (or version of scripts) to download and install a &lt;em>new&lt;/em> version of my website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case, I&amp;rsquo;ve probably moved to the data bags based definition of what that website is:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;filename&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;environment-qa.json&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;website&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;version&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;1.0.2&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If I&amp;rsquo;m going to upgrade that database, I probably want to just upgrade the data bag. The script remains the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This, to me, is a nirvana situation. I&amp;rsquo;m running stable scripts/recipes in all environments and am changing small elements of how they run to respect what environment they&amp;rsquo;re in. I&amp;rsquo;ve avoided duplication and therefore increased operatability of the solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, take a lesson from me, if you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a complex system with a lot of node types, decouple your application version from the scripts that are running. Your CI/CD pipeline will simplify and it will be simpler to know what changed, why, and how it affects your situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you follow the techniques outlined above, you&amp;rsquo;ll have no issue with migrating to Policyfiles. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to make sure that there is a solid business case for it. I think you&amp;rsquo;ll find that the return from better change management and easier operatability will more than pay for the costs you&amp;rsquo;ll incur from using the techniques above.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Policyfiles</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/policyfiles/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-policyfiles.jpg" alt="Policyfiles" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Recently at the &lt;a href="https://summit.chef.io/seattle/">Chef Community Summit&lt;/a>, I proposed a topic on &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/policyfile.html">Policyfiles&lt;/a>. Policyfiles are a new way to handle dependency and change management for your Chef infrastructure. During the session it became clear that there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough information out there on how and why to use Policyfiles. I realized that an introduction to Policyfiles for the Chef Community was far overdue and committed to the session that I would market the feature through this blog post and future podcast episode on the Food Fight Show.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="why-policyfiles">Why Policyfiles?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Early on in my Chef adoption, &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/">it became clear that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t deliver on the strict change management controls within the legacy Chef workflow without a lot of work&lt;/a>. With the traditional Chef workflow, you can update a cookbook in production and all of the sudden all of your nodes are running different code. Was it tested this way before? Well let&amp;rsquo;s hope so! &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s hope so&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it when you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with an enterprise as large and complicated as NCR. Our entire business rests on the trust our customers put into us to securely handle their financial transactions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>With Policyfiles you can guarantee that the exact same cookbooks that ran in earlier environments will run in later environments.&lt;/strong> You get real change management that is inuitive and doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave you trying to explain the intricacies of Chef dependency management in an outage call. &lt;strong>It just works.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another benefit we get out of Policyfiles is &lt;strong>it makes Chef easy to learn&lt;/strong>. Rather than burdening the user with a complex structure of roles, cookbooks, environments, and pinning, I can simply show them a Policyfile and show them the workflow I outline below. This greatly speeds up time I spend teaching my colleagues Chef. I challenge the Chef veterans who are reading this to explain Chef to someone using the workflow outlined below and watch the magic: you&amp;rsquo;ll see that they really get it at the end, and they went from nothing to a working solution far more quickly than you&amp;rsquo;re used to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That adoption cost has a real effect on the future of Chef. If there are less people in the community due to high barriers to entry, there are less &lt;a href="https://supermarket.chef.io">community cookbooks&lt;/a> and less opportunities for Chef Inc. to monetize the platform and therefore invest more into it. So, even if you have already defined complicated workarounds that address the deficiencies in the legacy workflow, I encourage you to adopt and support it in situations it makes sense. Keep an open mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="policyfile-workflow">Policyfile Workflow&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The best way to understand the Policyfile feature is by walking through an example. We&amp;rsquo;ll configure a webserver for one of our apps with Policyfiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="policyfilerb-file">Policyfile.rb file&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first thing we&amp;rsquo;ll start with is the &lt;code>Policyfile.rb&lt;/code> itself. &lt;strong>A Policyfile declares the name, run list, sources, and attributes for a node or group of nodes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though &lt;code>Policyfile.rb&lt;/code> is the default name for the policyfile, you can name it whatever you want. On our projects, there are usually many Policyfiles: we could have &lt;code>myapp-webserver.rb&lt;/code> and &lt;code>myapp-database.rb&lt;/code>. The name that you use has to be unique in your Chef server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out, the Policyfile will go in your application&amp;rsquo;s cookbook repo. As you advance, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to separate it into its own repository, because the frequent revisions of the lock file outlined below will clutter up your history. At this point we have about half and half Policyfiles in cookbooks vs. their own repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="creating-the-policyfile">Creating the Policyfile&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always good to start out with a generated policyfile to make the adoption a little easier. There are two ways to do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First you could generate the Policyfile directly:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>chef generate policyfile Policyfile.rb
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Or you can add the &lt;code>-P&lt;/code> flag to the &lt;code>chef generate cookbook&lt;/code> command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>chef generate cookbook myapp -P
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Either way you have a Policyfile generated and ready to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="basic-contents">Basic Contents&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once the Policyfile is generated, it should look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#0086b3">name&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;webserver&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># will be used later in Client.rb on the Node&lt;/span>
default_source &lt;span style="color:#990073">:supermarket&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;https://supermarket.mycompany.com&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># this uses only internal cookbooks&lt;/span>
run_list &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;recipe[myapp::webserver]&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># the run list of recipes; won&amp;#39;t contain roles&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># where to find cookbooks that are outside of the default_source&lt;/span>
cookbook &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;myapp&amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#990073">git&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;https://git.mycompany.com/devops/myapp&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s go over the elements:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Element&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>name&lt;/td>
&lt;td>used to reference this policyfile on the Chef server and it must be unique. As I said above, you probably want to come up with a naming convention for your Policies. We use &lt;code>applicationname-role.rb&lt;/code> for ours (like &lt;code>myapp-webserver&lt;/code>).&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>default_source&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This is where we get all of our cookbooks if they're not specifically declared in the lower section. This will usually be a supermarket.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>run_list&lt;/td>
&lt;td>In this model you don't declare a &lt;code>run_list&lt;/code> on the client itself. This maintains consistency between environments.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>cookbook&lt;/td>
&lt;td>declares the non-default location where chef can find this cookbook. In this case we'll find it on the git server.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h3 id="environment-specific-settings">Environment-specific settings&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Pretty quickly you&amp;rsquo;ll run into situations where you have environment specific settings. This is better avoided if at all possible; one possible solution is &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TEvElu6Wnbc">to use Consul&lt;/a> to deal with environment-specific settings. However, &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/all-or-nothing-changes/">it&amp;rsquo;s also important to make progress&lt;/a>, so you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to declare the settings in a structure that includes the &lt;code>policy_group&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># in the Policyfile:&lt;/span>
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;qa&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">myapp&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">database&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;qaserver01&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
}
}
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;uat&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">myapp&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">database&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;uatdbsrv32&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
}
}
default&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;production&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">myapp&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#990073">database&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;proddbsrv62&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then in our recipe code we can reference the &lt;code>policy_group&lt;/code> and easily get to our setting:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">database &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> node&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>node&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>policy_group&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;myapp&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;database&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Or you could take it one step closer and include the &lt;a href="https://github.com/poise/poise-hoist">poise-hoist&lt;/a> cookbook in your &lt;code>run_list&lt;/code> and simply write:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#998;font-style:italic"># with poise-hoist, you can&amp;#39;t tell if you&amp;#39;re using policyfiles&lt;/span>
database &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> node&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;myapp&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">][&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;database&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you want to learn about this in more detail, check out &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/policyfile-attributes/">my follow up post&lt;/a> that dives into this more deeply.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creation-of-the-policyfilelockjson-file">Creation of the Policyfile.lock.json file&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that you have a declaration of what you want to run on a machine and your environment-specific settings declared, it&amp;rsquo;s time to create a point in time snapshot of &lt;em>specific&lt;/em> dependencies Chef will use on a node. This is your actual policy and it is stored in your &lt;code>Policyfile.lock.json&lt;/code> file. This is the file that your node will read to pull dependencies down and run them locally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To generate your &lt;code>Policyfile.lock.json&lt;/code> file, run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>rm Policyfile.lock.json # remove any old lockfiles first
chef install Policyfile.rb
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This generates the following important attributes at the top of the file:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;revision_id&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">:&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;6156a875a7c0eb06ce9gdc9e3d4f19809752942efd6dd20888ddd9fd8bbbd43b5&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">,&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;name&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">:&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;platform&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">,&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;run_list&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">:&lt;/span> [
&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;recipe[platform::default]&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
]&lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">,&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;table>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Attribute&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>revision_id&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This is a &lt;b>very&lt;/b> important field, that will tell you what version of the policy you are running on the chef server and during your chef run. By committing the &lt;code>Policyfile.lock.json&lt;/code> file to source, you'll always be able to view &lt;b>exactly&lt;/b> what runs on the node by referring back to the version of this file by this revision.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>name&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The policy name, which you will declare as a node attribute to declare which policy the node uses. This is the "logical" connection to the policy.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>run_list&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A fully expanded list of recipes that will run. With this generation there is no doubt over what will run. This is a major benefit of this over using roles or environments, where there can be a doubt, and thus confusion and potential disaster.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Later down the file, we can see the output for one of our cookbooks:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;windows&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">:&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;version&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;1.40.0&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;identifier&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;54a9b2515c853919c4953893997899584d4cefba&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;dotted_decimal_identifier&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;23830481377985849.7253019596134776.168604533059514&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;cache_key&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;windows-1.40.0-supermarket.mycompany.com&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;origin&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;https://supermarket.mycompany.com:443/api/v1/cookbooks/windows/versions/1.40.0/download&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;source_options&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;artifactserver&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;https://supermarket.mycompany.com:443/api/v1/cookbooks/windows/versions/1.40.0/download&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;version&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;1.40.0&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can see here that there is a very specific declaration of the dependency for the cookbook. This is in the policyfile so if we wanted to regenerate all dependencies from this &lt;code>Policyfile.lock.json&lt;/code>, we can do so as long as we still have connectivity to the repositories on which the dependencies are stored. It&amp;rsquo;s important to also note that the &lt;code>identifier&lt;/code> here &lt;em>also&lt;/em> doubles as a checksum of the cookbook contents. If the contents change, but &lt;strong>nothing else&lt;/strong> changes, then &lt;code>chef-client&lt;/code> will refuse to run the policy. This is a tamper-proof mechanism that increases your ability to predict what code will run on your servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember, we are running this code with elevated privileges, so if you&amp;rsquo;re running in production, it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly important to predict what will happen. &lt;strong>You can&amp;rsquo;t easily predict outcomes without policyfiles.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pushing-it-to-the-chef-server">Pushing it to the Chef Server&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that we have a lockfile built, it&amp;rsquo;s time to make the policy active for our nodes. If our nodes, Chef Server, and development machine are all on the same network, we can simply push the policy to the Chef Server directly. If you&amp;rsquo;re doing this within CI and it&amp;rsquo;s possible on another agent or at another time, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to run &lt;code>chef install&lt;/code> first to ensure the cookbooks are locally cached. The &lt;code>chef install&lt;/code> command will &lt;em>not&lt;/em> replace the lockfile if it already exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>chef install Policyfile.rb # to ensure dependencies are loaded
chef push qa Policyfile.rb
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This will push the policy and all dependencies declared in the lockfile to the Chef Server for the &lt;code>qa&lt;/code> policy group. Once you run this command, you can guarantee that you can run it on a node. No more remembering to upload a specific dependency; it&amp;rsquo;s simply there for you to run and will include the exact same cookbooks that are in the lockfile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>qa&lt;/code> above is your policy group. &lt;strong>A policy group, similar to an environment, is a logical group of nodes that you want to have the same policy.&lt;/strong> Since many times you&amp;rsquo;ll be using the same Chef Server to manage multiple environments, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to split your nodes into different policy groups so you can make sure that you are flowing policy changes through a pipeline before they get to production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also note that you should &lt;em>never&lt;/em> run the &lt;code>chef update&lt;/code> command. Results of this are not easily predicatable, so I&amp;rsquo;ve stayed away from it. If you need to regenerate a lockfile, remove the old one and run &lt;code>chef install&lt;/code>. If you want to push the policy, ensure that the dependencies are loaded with &lt;code>chef install&lt;/code> and then push it with &lt;code>chef push&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-chef-client">Setting up Chef Client&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To get your node to have the appropriate policy name and group, you need to update its attributes. The easiest way to do this is when bootstrapping the node itself:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife bootstrap mywebserver --policy-group qa --policy-name webserver
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>If you, like me, have a node-centric bootstrapping mechanism, your bootstrapper will need to update node attributes using the &lt;code>-j&lt;/code> flag. First create attributes with the &lt;code>policy_name&lt;/code> and &lt;code>policy_group&lt;/code> in them:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">&lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">#&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a61717;background-color:#e3d2d2">attributes.json&lt;/span>
{
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;policy_name&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;webserver&amp;#34;&lt;/span>,
&lt;span style="color:#000080">&amp;#34;policy_group&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;qa&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And then run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>chef-client -j attributes.json
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>From there your node will use that policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to manually add the settings to &lt;code>client.rb&lt;/code> directly, but now know that this is bad because it will mean I have to manually update them again if I ever need to change it. Setting them in the node attributes directly allows me to change them remotely on the Chef Server.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="packaging-it-for-air-gapped-environments">Packaging it for Air Gapped environments&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re not always going to have a connected Chef Server available and may need to transfer your policy to an Air-Gapped environment. Policyfiles make this process incredibly easy because they package all dependencies into one file. To do this, start by running:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>chef export Policyfile.rb . -a
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This will export the all cookbooks listed in the &lt;code>Policyfile.lock.json&lt;/code> and the lockfile itself into a single archive. Now you can transfer this file to the air-gapped environment however you are used to doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an essential element of the benefits to Policyfiles in a security-conscious environment: &lt;strong>You get to keep the same controls you have in place while you begin implementing Chef!&lt;/strong> Yes, eventually you&amp;rsquo;ll do a CI/CD pipeline like &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/workflow.html">Chef Workflow&lt;/a> but &lt;strong>don&amp;rsquo;t let that get in the way of getting value out of Chef!&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s the absolute worst thing you could do. Create value early and often. Work around your existing controls and change the parts that you have buy-in to change. Repeat that and soon enough you&amp;rsquo;ll be in a good place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve generated the archive and transferred the file to your air-gapped environment, it&amp;rsquo;s time to load it up on the Chef Server, you can run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>chef push-archive qa Policyfile-6156a875a7c0eb06ce9gdc9e3d4f19809752942efd6dd20888ddd9fd8bbbd43b5.tar.gz
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Again, we&amp;rsquo;re declaring a policy group here, but this is pretty much the same as the &lt;code>chef push&lt;/code> command above. Your policy is active for that policy group on the Chef Server, and you can rest assured that all cookbooks are there ready to be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pipeline-management">Pipeline management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re going to want to add this workflow to a pipeline that we can manage in Jenkins or TeamCity. The process will roughly consist of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Cookbook builds, which include running Test Kitchen, ChefStyle linting, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Promotion to an internal supermarket (if you have one)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Updating pinned versions of those cookbooks in the Policyfile or in specific cookbooks through a pull request&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whenever the Policyfile.rb changes, or on demand, or when dependencies complete, rebuild the &lt;code>Policyfile.lock.json&lt;/code> file and check it in&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Push the &lt;code>Policyfile.lock.json&lt;/code> file to the Chef Server for locally available resources. If there is a pipeline, push to one policy group at a time and make sure they work before pushing out even further.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If there isn&amp;rsquo;t a Chef Server connected to your build environment, post the policyfile archive to be loaded by your air-gapped environment. Much of this can be automated, but you&amp;rsquo;ll find that there is a step where you have to physically deal with the air-gapped environment (by definition).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="which-policy-is-active">Which Policy is Active?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I said before, this revision id that is generated as a part of your lockfile will be the single identifier for this policy from here on out. So to see which policy is active you can simply run:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>chef show-policy webserver
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Which will generate:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>webserver
========
* qa: 6156a875a7
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Here you have the first ten characters of your revision id, and it is clear the exact versioin of the policy that is active for the &lt;code>qa&lt;/code> group. If you&amp;rsquo;re checking in your lockfiles through a pipeline, this revision id should be stored with your lockfile in your git repo and thus you can understand when it was created. You have a great understanding of the exact changes that went into your environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, when you run &lt;code>chef-client&lt;/code>, you see exactly the revision id and policy that is used:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>PS D:\chef&amp;gt; chef-client
Starting Chef Client, version 12.11.18
Using policy 'webserver' at revision '6156a875a7c0eb06ce9gdc9e3d4f19809752942efd6dd20888ddd9fd8bbbd43b5'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>So at all levels you have repeatability and traceability of all changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Chef Community should adopt Policyfiles because they are easier to learn than the legacy workflow, give you better control change management, and are more flexible for security-concious implementations. Hopefully this blog post will serve as an impetus for broader adoption of the feature and eventual inclusion into the Automate product suite.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chef with Windows</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-with-windows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-with-windows/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-chef-with-windows.jpg" alt="Chef with Windows" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Recently &lt;a href="https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-in-a-windows-monoculture-success-examples/9733/7">Peter Burkholder asked in the community&lt;/a> whether anyone was doing Chef at scale in a Windows environment and what lessons were learned along the way to make that happen. While we at NCR are certainly &lt;em>not&lt;/em> the first windows-oriented business to utilize Chef at scale, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG3OZologLU&amp;amp;t=45s">we are doing it&lt;/a> and I have a lot of experience and ideas that could be helpful to others. Many of those ideas have been solidified as &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">my wife&lt;/a> has been recently working with a lot of Microsoft-oriented people and I&amp;rsquo;ve had to explain the culture to her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first adopting a non-Microsoft technology can feel daunting. No matter where you go within the Microsoft landscape there is either a competing Microsoft-endorsed technology or one that is rumored to be in on its way. So you get a lot of people who will see that something isn&amp;rsquo;t from them and just dismiss it outright.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another hurdle to overcome is that people within this culture view open source as chaotic and expensive. Many people outside of the Microsoft ecosystem view open source as a driver for innovation and thus tolerate the chaos that happens when trying to get it to work. People who have spent their careers with Microsoft technologies don&amp;rsquo;t think that way; they want it to work, be intuitive, documented, and they want to get someone on the phone if something goes wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For these reasons, in an organization that has heavily invested in Microsoft, I would &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> start with the awesomeness of the technology. This will get you nowhere. Instead, &lt;strong>it all boils down to the business case for the proposed change&lt;/strong>. Do we need to do configuration management with Chef or do we need to use System Center or some other related technology? It&amp;rsquo;s a great question and probably one that should be considered through deep investigation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Find the business case by demonstrating that the current process isn&amp;rsquo;t working either by keeping costs high (usually labor) or delaying business opportunities (usually new development). The more you can get on the right side of that business case, the better time everyone will have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if the business is using GPOs for managing configuration state on the active directory, then do a compliance scan against your nodes and see how they line up with the CIS benchmark for Windows Server 2012. Oh wait&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s total chaos. Why? Hint: people are using remote desktop to make your system unmanageable by making one-off changes&amp;hellip;everywhere. Another hint: this is absolute insanity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep digging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can you get a machine up and running quickly? Why not? Would chef help with that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need to configure a third party tool like monitoring or logging, can you do that effectively? Sure it&amp;rsquo;s great when all you do is Microsoft and it all fits together nicely, but is that realistic?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What happens to your operations costs when we take away the UI when looking at the Microsfot stack (or even Windows Server 2016)? They will go way down, but you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get there without automation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you want to go to Azure? Do you realize that going to azure without an automation plan is like buying a tank, driving around a city (your business) and pushing random buttons? It&amp;rsquo;s going to cause damage if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a radical change towards automation. In other words, the problems you have been facing related to scale do not have anything to do with the fact that you had to call Dell before to get hardware racked. It&amp;rsquo;s everything after that too! So will System Center help you there?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answers to all these questions, as with many technologies, is&amp;hellip;maybe Microsoft is the best way, but usually not. That&amp;rsquo;s another quite irritating aspect of Microsoft stuff. It can do everything. It solves everyone&amp;rsquo;s problems. So when you&amp;rsquo;re in this environment look at the results! Don&amp;rsquo;t let the Microsoft sales person or the single excited Microsoft-solves-all-problems person get you sucked into ignoring common sense for your business. &lt;strong>If the tools you are using don&amp;rsquo;t drive you to the outcomes you want, then consider changing the tools and the culture behind those tools (the people).&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real question is &lt;strong>what level of support do you need to get these things done?&lt;/strong> I think Microsoft is a fantastic platform for enterprise-level development and they have an excellent cloud solution for enterprises. But they also have a long legacy and entire culture centered around the message that you can do IT with little training and a few button clicks. By the way, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Uvq38XOark">this is the exact culture that Jeffrey Snover has fought for years and years&lt;/a>. Snover has done great things, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that the culture he fought still exists, is going strong, and, even worse, is feeling threatened right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So as a business who do you want to align with? Sure, you have a strong and great history with Microsoft and an entire staff that knows about it. But you also need a partnership with another company to get you to where you want to be in above opportunities. Chef is an excellent choice in this regard. You have a whole group of people at Chef Inc. who really get Microsoft (like &lt;a href="http://www.hurryupandwait.io/">Matt Wrock&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://stevenmurawski.com/">Steve Murawski&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://stuartpreston.net/">Stuart Preston&lt;/a> (a partner), &lt;a href="http://www.theubergeekgirl.com/">Jessica DeVita&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trevorghess?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Trevor Hess&lt;/a> (a partner) to name a few). This core brings Windows into the Chef ecosystem as a first class citizen. They advocate for DSC and align themselves with PowerShell/Snover. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic Windows configuration management platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also for a large 100+ node organization the other sell is that having a relationship with Chef gets you access to those best practices and people to accelerate the transformation. The consulting I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten from Chef regarding my approach is probably more valuable than the software itself because it has been absolutely critical to get us to the point where we can take advantage of the software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve covered the most important thing, the outcomes, let&amp;rsquo;s talk a little about technology: what about linux?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you focus on the business outcomes, create an early adopter groundswell of support, then the linux question should solve itself. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-technical-asshole-curse/">someone is being an asshole&lt;/a>. If that&amp;rsquo;s true take them to lunch and understand their needs, then incorporate that into your overall strategy. If they still don&amp;rsquo;t listen then by this point they&amp;rsquo;re clearly being an asshole, so make that reality visible to leadership and work towards getting around that person. The fact of the matter is that a company whose leadership is incapable of taking advantage of fantastic strategic and ROI business opportunities because of a few people who can&amp;rsquo;t handle learning another OS is not one with a bright future. Someone at some level should be able to see this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If they fail to see it after all that, then you are indeed on a sinking ship. That would be quite depressing if there weren&amp;rsquo;t so many non-sinking ships all around you that will embrace and love what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.ncr.com/careers">you should come work with me at NCR&lt;/a>. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating from Chef Analytics to Chef Visibility</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/analytics-to-visibility/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/analytics-to-visibility/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-analytics-to-visibility.jpg" alt="Analytics to Visibility" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The other day I was at lunch with my customer architect at Chef. We were talking about our situation. Our reference architecture fits Chef&amp;rsquo;s reference architecture from about a year ago, which consists of a Chef Server and an Analytics Server as the core solution. Change takes a while, so I had been delaying setting up a Chef Automate environment before I got some other things accomplished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, at lunch we both were convinced that a &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/visibility.html">Chef Visibility node&lt;/a> could easily replace a Chef Analytics node and set our teams up better for where Chef is going. We would set the server up in a POC mode which would mean we had no real backup plan, but that&amp;rsquo;s OK because we are not really using Chef Analytics in a useful way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This strategy is pretty typical of one I&amp;rsquo;ve used lately: &lt;strong>let people see what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about and interact with it, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not in the &amp;ldquo;perfect final state&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>. Then, with experience as a guide, take the next step to do it the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way. We will likely end up with a central Visibility server but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to risk everything just to make that happen. So we set this up instead and move things forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the discussion with my customer architect, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-cate-9b63a28">Thomas Cate&lt;/a> helped me come up with this guide. I wrote everything down and thought it might be good to share with the community, in case anyone else was thinking of going this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="migration-steps">Migration Steps&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This will migrate an existing Chef Analytics Server to a Chef Visibility Server in POC mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="back-up-your-keys-on-the-analytics-server">Back up your keys on the analytics server&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re getting ready to uninstall Analytics, but we want to keep the keys because we&amp;rsquo;ll use them later.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Find the key location in &lt;code>/etc/opscode-analytics/opscode-analytics.rb&lt;/code>. The keys will likely be located in &lt;code>/etc/pki/tls/certs&lt;/code> and &lt;code>/etc/pki/tls/private&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Back up the keys to &lt;code>~/cert-backup&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="clean-and-uninstall-chef-analytics">Clean and uninstall Chef Analytics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s get rid of analytics now:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>opscode-analytics-ctl cleanse&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>opscode-analytics-ctl stop&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the package &lt;code>yum remove opscode-analytics&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>sudo rm -rf /opt/opscode-analytics&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reboot server &lt;code>sudo reboot now&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="remove-analytics-from-the-chef-server">Remove Analytics from the Chef Server&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On the Chef Server,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>open &lt;code>/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb&lt;/code> and comment out ocid for analytics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>run &lt;code>chef-server-ctl reconfigure&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="install-automate">Install Automate&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Navigate to the &lt;a href="https://downloads.chef.io/automate/">downloads page&lt;/a> and copy the appropriate link&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On the Analytics Server, wget that link to download it to the user home, for example: &lt;code>wget https://packages.chef.io/stable/el/7/delivery-0.5.370-1.el7.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code> for my CentOS box&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install the package, on CentOS: &lt;code>sudo rpm -Uvh delivery-0.5.370-1.el6.x86_64.rpm&lt;/code>. When it asks you to configure the Delivery Server, say no&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="set-up-licensing">Set up Licensing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll need to get a &lt;code>delivery.license&lt;/code> from a friend at Chef. You also get your pem key for your Chef Server as a one-time use to authenticate to it and add workflow stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m not using that, so this was not really needed, but you know, we do it anyways.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>sudo delivery-ctl setup --license ~/delivery.license --key ~/[your-name].pem --server-url https://[your-chef-server]/organizations/[your-org] --fqdn analytics.[your-domain].com&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When it asks for an organization, use your company name. The organization can be the same for different visibility servers. In fact, one can argue in this situation it&amp;rsquo;s quite useless; it&amp;rsquo;s more for multitenancy.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You should probably copy the &lt;code>server-url&lt;/code> from your &lt;code>knife.rb&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finalize-installation">Finalize installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>run &lt;code>sudo delivery-ctl reconfigure&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>check that the settings in &lt;code>/etc/delivery/delivery.rb&lt;/code> are good (especially the FQDN)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="set-up-certificates">Set up certificates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to reuse your certificates that you backed up earlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Put the ssl certs in place &lt;code>/var/opt/delivery/nginx/ca&lt;/code> - &lt;strong>Important:&lt;/strong> these files need to same name as what is there by default. So you should copy by name and change the file name of what you had before.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Restart nginx &lt;code>sudo delivery-ctl restart nginx&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure it&amp;rsquo;s working with &lt;code>delivery-ctl status&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="set-up-an-admin-user">Set up an Admin User&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>delivery-ctl create-enterprise [enterprise] --ssh-pub-key-file=/etc/delivery/builder_key.pub&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This will generate user information that will be output to your command line:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Created enterprise: companyname
Admin username: admin
Admin password: blahblahblah
Builder Password: blahblahblah-2
Web login: https://analytics.mycompany.com/e/companyname/
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Navigate to that web login and you should see the automate login. Login with &amp;ldquo;admin&amp;rdquo; and the password it gives you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="set-up-more-users">Set up more users&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this point you can change the admin password to something you can remember and add users. This has to be separate from the Chef Server because there are many Chef Servers to one Visibility Server. Well, not in this case, but that&amp;rsquo;s the design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you have two options:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Set up a bunch of users manually&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up LDAP authentication following &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/integrate_delivery_ldap.html">these directions&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="configure-data-collector-on-chef-visibility-server">Configure Data Collector on Chef Visibility server&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now I&amp;rsquo;m going to set up a token for configuring a data collector for my clients to talk to the Chef Visiblity server:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create a Guid (on PowerShell I ran: &lt;code>[guid]::NewGuid()&lt;/code>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add data collector configuration to &lt;code>/etc/delivery/delivery.rb&lt;/code>:
&lt;code>data_collector['token'] = 'my-guid-here'&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>sudo delivery-ctl reconfigure&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="configure-chef-server-to-report-to-visibility">Configure Chef Server to report to Visibility&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll also need &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/setup_visibility_chef_automate.html#configure-chef-server-to-send-server-object-data">the Chef Server to report to Visibility&lt;/a>. To do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Add the following settings to &lt;code>/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb&lt;/code>:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">data_collector&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;root_url&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#39;https://my-automate-server.mycompany.com/data-collector/v0/&amp;#39;&lt;/span>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="configure-chef-client-to-report-to-visiblity">Configure Chef Client to report to Visiblity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll need to make sure your Chef-Client is on a fairly recent version. For me I need to update chef-client in my infrastructure to 12.15.19 for this to work properly. I had some problems on an earlier version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;re on the latest, let&amp;rsquo;s configure the &lt;code>data_collector&lt;/code> on the node in the &lt;code>client.rb&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">data_collector&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>server_url &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;https://analytics.yourcompany.ncr/data-collector/v0/&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
data_collector&lt;span style="color:#000;font-weight:bold">.&lt;/span>token &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;guid-from-previous-step&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="configure-notification-replacement-for-analytics">Configure Notification replacement for Analytics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We were taking advantage of the notifications in Chef Analytics and needed a replacement. My colleague has written &lt;a href="https://github.com/jkerry/SimpleSlackHandler">a slack notifier report handler&lt;/a> for Chef that we&amp;rsquo;re now using.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="initial-thoughts-on-visibility">Initial Thoughts on Visibility&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed with the Chef team for thinking out of the box and getting me on their new platform in a way that works for me. This underscores once again why they&amp;rsquo;re a great partner: &lt;strong>Chef doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up with an inflexible agenda; they listen, find the &lt;em>right&lt;/em> solution, and then execute.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first impressions of the product are that it looks very nice and clean. I can tell Chef has hired some UX people. :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visibility definitely has room to grow but it&amp;rsquo;s an exciting start to a great platform for making Chef operable at scale within the enterprise. While some in the open source community might elect to roll their own reporting platform for Chef-related stuff, to us that&amp;rsquo;s the path pain and discomfort, because we realize that we&amp;rsquo;ll never have the funding that Chef has to deliver this. And they like hearing from people like me give them feedback. So to me that&amp;rsquo;s the best of both worlds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t like how the Visibility product is tied to workflow, though. I can understand how Chef wants to sell an all-in-one solution, but to me it&amp;rsquo;s better to design your products with as little coupling as possible so they can be independent. From their perspective, it may make sense; keep things simple so your support can be focused in one direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m really glad I converted my Chef Analytics server to a Visibility server. Hopefully this helps you do the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Margin for Leadership</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/margin-for-leadership/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/margin-for-leadership/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>There was a phase in early 2014 where I had a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of new initiatives going. In retrospect, I was smack dab in the middle of a horrible career calculation. I had gotten excited about DevOps, told my management about it, and found myself on a project to get all of our development teams &lt;em>operating&lt;/em> on the same development tools. Needless to say I was in a lot of meetings with people who were looking at me angrily as a complete waste of their time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was during this time that I really dropped the ball on mentoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would be in meetings all day, and the poor members of my team would need my help in growing and learning and I would be absent. They would try to catch me as I walked very briefly to my desk before going to the next meeting. It was really bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I realized a valuable lesson during that season. If you&amp;rsquo;re in meetings all day and don&amp;rsquo;t have time for people around you, then you and others around you are going to stagnate. That may be fine for people at a certain level, but for most of us that is &lt;strong>a very bad thing&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to create margin in my day so I can check in with people. I keep my calendar blocked during a portion of the day and I &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/planning-vs-execution">focus on planning&lt;/a> and also on &lt;em>talking to people&lt;/em>. I reach out to them, make sure that we have an &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/exposing-the-unknown/">open line of communication&lt;/a> and that they have a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/internalizing-the-plan/">solid plan themselves&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to mentor people, put room in your day for it. You &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to create margin in your position for leadership. Your work isn&amp;rsquo;t all about what you &lt;em>do&lt;/em> yourself today, it&amp;rsquo;s more about doing the smart things and enabling those around you to do the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Goal</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-goal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-goal/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-the-goal.jpg" alt="The Goal" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A while back I was working with someone who wasn&amp;rsquo;t new to technology, but was new to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/category/process/">the style of software development&lt;/a> that my team was operating within. We worked on &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/exposing-the-unknown/">getting honest about where he was at&lt;/a> over the first few weeks of working together. I could tell this was uncomfortable for him, and, frankly since then I&amp;rsquo;ve also grown in my empathy for the fear and difficulty experienced by being new with a new technology or process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember clearly talking to my colleague in a 1:1 that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t where he needed to be to be successful. He knew it. I knew it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s usually a bad place. That&amp;rsquo;s usually the place where people give up on each other. That&amp;rsquo;s the place where both parties start making plans to get themselves out of the uncomfortable situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of doing that, though, we talked about his goals. What did he want to get out of this job? Out of his life? What is he missing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we aligned his goals with mine by creating a growth plan that identified some training opportunities, coding challenges, and regular communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few years later and my colleague is doing well. He made the transition. I see so many managers take the easy way out by their inability to see what&amp;rsquo;s possible in people. If you had a chance to change someone&amp;rsquo;s life by helping them gain valuable skills and insights that will serve them the rest of their lives, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you take it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watching lives change through clear goals has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my career.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Planning vs. Execution</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/planning-vs-execution/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/planning-vs-execution/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-planning-vs-execution.jpg" alt="Planning vs Execution" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When you&amp;rsquo;re new at something, you&amp;rsquo;re excited and want to prove yourself, and you want to get to that &amp;ldquo;proving&amp;rdquo; of yourself as quickly as possible. There is a lot of tension in your life through feeling &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; at that thing, and that tension is uncomfortable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other day &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">Annie&lt;/a> and I were talking about something she was working on. We were breaking the problem down into &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/exposing-the-unknown/">steps that she understood&lt;/a> and she was beginning to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/internalizing-the-plan/">internalize the plan&lt;/a>. She was eager to put the plan into action and getting excited about the newfound insights she had gained from our discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then she made a tactical mistake: she got so excited about the plan, that she started working on that plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That sounds great, and it is great in principle, but the problem with her approach to &lt;em>just get started with it&lt;/em> was that we really weren&amp;rsquo;t done planning out the whole of what she was working on to accomplish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This mistake is similar to what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen over and over with newer people in technology. Early on in my career I worked with a friend of mine that always wrote everything down. I would kind of make fun of him&amp;hellip;but then realized that his organization and plan meant that he executed at a level that I didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I started writing things down. I started making a plan. And I started really focusing on the &lt;em>planning phase&lt;/em> of my work. I was also able to separate the &lt;em>planning phase&lt;/em> from the &lt;em>execution phase&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you&amp;rsquo;re executing on a great plan, it&amp;rsquo;s like the wind is at your back and everything is easy. When you&amp;rsquo;re working without a good plan, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re new to something, you get onto an emotional rollercoaster of unclear expectations. The key to growth is making &lt;em>finding the plan&lt;/em> just as important as &lt;em>executing on the plan&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Internalizing the Plan</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/internalizing-the-plan/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/internalizing-the-plan/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-internalizing-the-plan.jpg" alt="Internalizing the Plan" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As I wrote about in &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/exposing-the-unknown/">my last post&lt;/a> it&amp;rsquo;s extremely important when working with someone new to technology to create an honest and open relationship with them where they feel free and even supported to tell you that they don&amp;rsquo;t know something. I really love it when I try my best to explain something and the person I&amp;rsquo;m working with is free enough to tell me that they don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. A part of me comes alive whenever that happens because I know that honesty is the basis for growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s easy in a technical context to focus on the technical journey that someone needs to make in order to be effective. Do they know proper source control, how to interact with a good coding editor in an efficient way, a great coding editor, and how to write tests? These are all important topics and ones that &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">Annie&lt;/a> and I covered extensively in the early days of her journey into technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s the easy part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the hard part: are they able to create a plan and internalize it? I think that&amp;rsquo;s the true test to make sure we&amp;rsquo;re on the right path.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always horrible when I go over a plan with someone and they look at me enthusiastically, nodding, then at the end they can&amp;rsquo;t articulate the plan to get there. If that happens, then &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/exposing-the-unknown/">we have to work a bit more on honestly&lt;/a>. What I work on early on in any mentoring relationship is that we have an honest conversation back and forth about where we are and where we are going, and break things down &lt;em>at the level that the person understands&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes this means we create a list of things to do &lt;em>in the next few hours&lt;/em> that covers exact files to change and relate them to a diagram on the whiteboard we just drew. That&amp;rsquo;s fine with me as long as (1) they know what they need to do, for real, and aren&amp;rsquo;t faking it, and (2) they can internalize it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you can&amp;rsquo;t internalize a plan enough to tell someone about it, you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. No amount of googling is going to change that. You &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to plan ahead, and at a level that &lt;em>you&lt;/em> understand. Never let a mentor plan &lt;em>above&lt;/em> your understanding, and, if you&amp;rsquo;re mentoring someone, seek to find out where they are and ensure there is a solid plan &lt;em>at that level&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exposing the Unknown</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/exposing-the-unknown/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/exposing-the-unknown/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-exposing-the-unknown.jpg" alt="Exposing the Unknown" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When someone starts on my team, regardless of their experience level but &lt;em>especially&lt;/em> if they&amp;rsquo;re new to technology, my first goal is to ensure that we are honest in our communication with each other. This is easier said than done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From their perspective, you just gave them this job and they now have to prove things to you. If they don&amp;rsquo;t understand what you&amp;rsquo;re saying but think they might be able to google it later, what&amp;rsquo;s the benefit in getting you to explain it to them? It&amp;rsquo;s much safer to just try to figure it out and to bend the truth a little bit on whether they are understanding what you&amp;rsquo;re saying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, if you&amp;rsquo;re the senior person who has a handle on this project, to the new person you &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> like a magical wizard who is casting spells. Especially if they&amp;rsquo;re new, they haven&amp;rsquo;t wrapped their minds around what you work on every day, and so the effortlessness by which you solve problems to them is &lt;em>extremely intimidating&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We humans are hardwired to &lt;em>not&lt;/em> be vulnerable when in extremely frightening and scary situations. We&amp;rsquo;re hardwired to hide and let the danger pass. So it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that lack of honesty is a major initial issue to deal with when working with people who are just getting started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I solve it: whenever I start working with someone who is very junior, the first thing I do is find something that I &lt;em>know&lt;/em> they don&amp;rsquo;t know. Then we talk through it and I do the best job I know how of explaining that thing, all the while knowing that it&amp;rsquo;s probably not sufficient for them to get it because I can&amp;rsquo;t read their mind. Then I ask them if they get it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They will almost always say, &amp;ldquo;Yeah that makes sense.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is when I know we have a great opportunity to establish a solid working relationship, because I know that they don&amp;rsquo;t get it but they are telling me they do. So then I say, &amp;ldquo;Great, then please explain it to me.&amp;rdquo; And usually they can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point, I communicate to them that &lt;strong>I don&amp;rsquo;t expect them to know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, even after I explain it to them. Instead, I expect two things from them: (1) that they honestly tell me when they don&amp;rsquo;t know and (2) that they ask questions that will help them understand.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So our relationship of learning is based on trust now: I trust that they&amp;rsquo;ll be honest and engage with me, and they trust me that I will accept them for not knowing, or even forgetting something I&amp;rsquo;ve told them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had so much success with helping people grow when I&amp;rsquo;ve established this level of trust early on. Instead of months of frustration while they go through the wildnerness of confusion and dealing with impostor syndrome, we can get to the bottom of what we need to do and make a plan for getting better. It&amp;rsquo;s so rewarding to see people light up when you say to them, &amp;ldquo;I know that you&amp;rsquo;re not where you want to be; here&amp;rsquo;s a timeline of how to get you there.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re working on real problems now and not using fear to hide!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I encourage you, if you&amp;rsquo;re working with someone junior to you on your team, have some compassion, understand the fear that is involved, and work hard to create an honest and supportive relationship with them. It will pay dividends for months and years to come.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Summer of Discovery</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/summer-of-discovery/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2016 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/summer-of-discovery/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-summer-of-discovery.jpg" alt="Summer of Discovery" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hiding out a bit this summer, but hopefully you trust me enough to know that I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to a lot. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">my wife&lt;/a> decided it was time to go back to work after a decade out of the full time workforce. She considered a lot of different options, but after a few initial experiments we quickly realized that she would be a great fit in technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling her almost since I met her how great technology is and how much we need people like her in it. She would always tell me the reasons why she didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do it, like that she wanted to be more creative or that it sounded boring. It always frustrated me because I knew from my own experience that working in technology is one of the most creative and interesting jobs I know of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So Annie &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com/introduction">decided to give it a shot&lt;/a> after a great dinner with some colleagues of mine at &lt;a href="http://www.ncr.com">NCR&lt;/a> and some good friends at &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/category/chef">Chef&lt;/a>. From there, I devoted almost all of my free time to helping her map out the path to take from her art/film background to a full-time technology job. That path included taking advantage of her strengths: &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">blogging&lt;/a>, networking, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7i4JE4Zk7w">connecting with people&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com/elasticsearch-network-hosts">getting obsessed about solving problems&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also included a lot of growing pains. Some of our experiments failed. In June we were convinced that it would be great to learn Ruby enough to write custom InSpec resources, but that proved to be too difficult to accomplish at the time. We had to keep thinking about what was working, what wasn&amp;rsquo;t, and adjusting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have found the process to be incredibly fascinating and rewarding. For a long time, I have been frustrated by the lack of diversity in technology. How are we going to get past this? Are we going to wait twenty to thirty years for higher education to figure it out?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe there is a huge transfer of wealth and power to those who can harness technology. Are we going to allow that transfer to unequally go to white men who for their whole lives were &lt;em>always&lt;/em> told that they naturally fit into technology? Or are we going to break through the misconceptions and outright falsehoods that permeate our industry and help people take advantage of this fantastically liberating industry?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Annie is on her way to a great career; I can already see it. Stay tuned &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">on her blog&lt;/a> with what her next gig will be&amp;hellip;you&amp;rsquo;ll hear about it soon. Going forward, I want to write a few posts about some things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the years and with Annie on how to work with people who are new to technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve realized through this experience that it isn&amp;rsquo;t intuitive for people. If we&amp;rsquo;re really going to have positive change in including everyone in this fantastic shift in our economy, we are going to have to get &lt;em>way better&lt;/em> at helping new people quickly become productive and valuable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finding Alignment</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/finding-alignment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2016 08:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/finding-alignment/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-finding-alignment.jpg" alt="Finding Alignment" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of things on my plate right now, but let me be clear: I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stand in the way of what the business wants to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been told this many times before. In the early days of trying to create alignment for initiatives that are important to our strategy, I would have taken it as a sign of support. Instead, I translate it into what this same person would say to her boss about this same subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Michael came and talked to me about [Awesome Initiative]. (Sigh) He says it&amp;rsquo;s going to really change things for us. Are we really going to waste our time with this crap or are we going to serve our customers? I&amp;rsquo;ll do whatever, but fair warning: this project has &amp;lsquo;disaster&amp;rsquo; written all over it, and you won&amp;rsquo;t get that feature you&amp;rsquo;ve been asking for either, you can kiss that goodbye for this year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s quite a different story, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how to respond? I&amp;rsquo;ve been tempted in the past to write people off and try to do it anyways. I&amp;rsquo;ve found over the years though that this is a mistake, because a sufficiently motivated individual &lt;em>can&lt;/em> and &lt;em>will&lt;/em> destroy your project if they don&amp;rsquo;t feel listened to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the keys are** respect** and** empathy**.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Respect&lt;/strong> can&amp;rsquo;t be faked. I can&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> only respect my opinion, or those of the consultants I&amp;rsquo;m working with, and then merely try to get &lt;em>you&lt;/em> on board with &lt;em>my&lt;/em> project. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. People see past that. Instead, I need to walk into the relationship with the understanding and true belief that you are a smart person with real needs that may be solvable by what I&amp;rsquo;m working on. This is a discovery of where your needs meet my solutions. I&amp;rsquo;m open to changing my solution because I cannot possibly predict all of your needs without your iterative interaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Empathy&lt;/strong> is key because I really need to &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> what you&amp;rsquo;re feeling, from a business perspective, and even from a personal perspective. What makes you excited or happy? What are you afraid of? What is painful for you? How does that affect you? Is there anything I can do to help you with that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following this pattern has led me to understand that, at a generic level, different groups have a natural alignment and misalignment with DevOps:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Team&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Natural Alignment&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Natural Misalignment&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Development&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Faster Delivery of features&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Have to be engaged in operations, more &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; to do&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Operations&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Less fires, more consistency&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Have to learn a new skillset and be a beginner&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Security&lt;/td>
&lt;td>More consistency, compliance&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Automation can cause unknown vulnerabilities&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Business&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Faster ROI for development, lower cost for operations, and a scale model that works&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Takes ongoing investment in culture and tools&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>As I focus on respect and empathy I can find the natural alignment and mitigate the natural misalignment with each group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For developers&lt;/strong> we can help them deliver features faster and thus get a truly agile feedback loop. But we can also help them culturally begin to share the ownership of the operatability of their product with the operations team. The key is ensuring that their desire for consistency and velocity outweighs their disdain for caring about how it works in production. We do this by finding their pain points in operations, catch them &lt;em>blaming&lt;/em> operations for those pain points, then show them that they actually can do something about their problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For QA&lt;/strong> we can help them deliver features more safely by minimizing the amount of time they spend creating environments and ensuring that they have consistent, hardened environments. This is all exciting, but they must engage the other teams to define infrastructure and they must be willing to not be lazy and just &amp;ldquo;click the damn checkbox in IIS when they want something changed. Culturally they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a problem with this, but in reality QA always gets changes at the end of a release or sprint and is under a time crunch to ensure quality. So we work with them to show them how much time they are spending on this and how we can use automation to get them focused on the important stuff: ensuring quality in a way that computers can&amp;rsquo;t or writing automation against production-like environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For Operations&lt;/strong> we can help them avoid the unexpected problems that come about without good automated configuration management. But to them, it comes at a cost. Many of the things that made them successful (incident resolution, working crazy hours, following directions) aren&amp;rsquo;t compatible with creating and engaging with automation. So they have to be fine with starting from scratch and building themselves back up. They have to see a payoff if they&amp;rsquo;re going to take that kind of career and time risk. The payoff in my mind is that they get to do more valuable work for the business by automating things and that value will translate into a more rewarding job for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For Security&lt;/strong> we can help them achieve the consistency and compliance at all levels that has alluded them. Yes they have controls defined and exercised in production. But they struggle with other teams thinking of them as a blocker to progress. Also, as we automate more, they&amp;rsquo;re afraid that we are going to take &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3022707/Worst-valet-Hapless-garage-attendant-destroys-300-000-Ferrari-599-GTO-bringing-round-owners-hit-accelerator-instead-brake.html">this nice shiny devops Ferrari and wreck it into a wall.&lt;/a> So we work on automating compliance and on developing a change management process that ensures proper control and separation of duties into production. We don&amp;rsquo;t fight them. We work with them to achieve &lt;em>their&lt;/em> goals. Once this happens, the perceived &amp;ldquo;blocker becomes a champion and driver of our changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For Management&lt;/strong> they get the benefits outlined above. But they also have to lead a cultural transformation. We can&amp;rsquo;t do it the easy way when that means &amp;ldquo;just running the command or &amp;ldquo;clicking that checkbox over there. We have to be committed to a repeatable, auditable process for change. So we need to train the people we have with new skills and be patient as they figure this out. We need to be OK with someone spending a little while on automating that thing, because the payoff will be huge over the next few years. And we need to be OK with absorbing the cost of tooling and vendor partnerships to realize the dream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once we see the lay&amp;quot;way, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to get everyone to the goal together. While I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that one won&amp;rsquo;t encounter the statement at the beginning of the post, I can guarantee that following this model will give someone something &lt;em>constructive&lt;/em> to do afterwards.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finding Habitat</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/finding-habitat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2016 07:39:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/finding-habitat/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A few months ago I caught up with Julian Dunn in Ghent about what he was up to. His &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF9IATUask">talk on orchestration&lt;/a> was instrumental in forming &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/orchestration-maturity-model-with-chef/">our approach&lt;/a> to solving the problem with Consul and his &lt;a href="http://www.juliandunn.net/2015/12/04/the-oncoming-train-of-enterprise-container-deployments/">blog post on docker&lt;/a> showed me he was thinking deeply and critically about some interesting topics. I reached out to him to learn more about what he was up to and spent some time with him to learn about Habitat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I learned that Fletcher Nichol was also working on the project, I got even more excited. Fletcher&amp;rsquo;s work on &lt;a href="http://kitchen.ci/">Test Kitchen&lt;/a> has &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/">revolutionized our workflow&lt;/a>. Recently, I saw it lower the barrier to entry for &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com/">my wife&lt;/a> to learn Chef. There really is a &amp;ldquo;before Kitchen&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;after Kitchen&amp;rdquo; epoch in her learning. It&amp;rsquo;s that revolutionary. And to see that Fletcher was focusing on this problem as well was quite exciting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.chef.io/blog/2016/06/14/introducing-habitat/">Adam Jacob&amp;rsquo;s blog post &lt;/a> left me both intrigued me and a little confused. I wanted to understand what Habitat was and how it fit into Chef&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and strategy. So I watched the event and got on twitter and had a fun time figuring it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was clear to me even from my early talks with Julian that Habitat was a disruptive technology. This is yet another reason why &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/technology-partnership/">Chef is such a good partner for us&lt;/a>. I can trust them to prioritize &lt;em>the right solution&lt;/em> for me over whether this will help their sales numbers this quarter. That trust drives sales higher than other companies because navigating this journey is difficult and we need people on our side who will tell us the hard truths on how to arrive at our destination. So kudos to Chef and its leadership for being so brave to make this step that says &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s another aspect to the problem that could be better, here&amp;rsquo;s what we think&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, the initial message of Habitat didn&amp;rsquo;t resonate with me. I feel that it suffered from a few flaws that hurt it&amp;rsquo;s ability to resonate with enterprise customers like me:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;re doing it wrong&lt;/strong>. I reread the narrative about the siloed enterprise and the big web and am still struggling to understand it. What I felt initially is &amp;ldquo;how you have been approaching the problem of configuration management is all wrong.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m honestly not sure whether that should have been the feeling I got because honestly I still don&amp;rsquo;t understand the narrative they were going for. I do know that a good pitch to enterprise people &lt;em>should not&lt;/em> start with the message &amp;ldquo;your organization is fundamentally improperly structured&amp;rdquo; People don&amp;rsquo;t like to hear that. And even if they agree, there is nothing they can do about it. The message (intended or not) isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary because Habitat doesn&amp;rsquo;t ask you to change any of that (see my revised message below).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Here is a Cool Solution.&lt;/strong> And it is. You put some really great people on this project for months or more, I expect it to be cool. But from an enterprise perspective its coolness carries little weight on whether it will help us solve the problems we are having. I would have preferred some discussion on what outcomes the team was able to accomplish as they partnered with an early customer, preferably from the enterprise. What did they do? Is it better? Why? Without this context it was difficult to put the solution in context.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Context?&lt;/strong> This was the part I struggled with the most. How does Habitat fit into the Chef ecosystem? Where does it start and Chef begin? What problems does it solve that &lt;em>both&lt;/em> products could solve? Why would I choose one over the other? It was difficult to understand, especially over the medium of twitter where characters are limited and tone isn&amp;rsquo;t easily communicated.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Am I still excited about Habitat? Absolutely! After talking with a few people and with Julian for 15 minutes or so, I can now think about it in terms that make sense to me that I can share with others in our organization. In the spirit of providing alternatives when sharing problems, &lt;strong>here&amp;rsquo;s the pitch I would give if someone in my organization would ask me about it today&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Chef&amp;rsquo;s has done an outstanding job with configuration management of infrastructure. This is why they are our partner. They have built upon that core competency with a reporting product to see what&amp;rsquo;s happening and a delivery product to manage changes. On top of that (and most importantly for us), they even help make your infrastructure more secure by helping you scan your infrastructure for security vulnerabilities and use Chef to remediate them. With Chef it is very easy to get a secure, hardened infrastructure configured for your business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s not all you want to do, though. You want applications &lt;em>running&lt;/em> on that infrastructure. And it turns out when you start down this path, things get complicated quickly. You face problems that aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> configuration management problems like orchestration or service discovery. You have to figure out how to scale. And you have an application team that wants to focus on &lt;em>those issues&lt;/em> rather than configure a specific machine to run. They might even insist on &lt;em>not&lt;/em> running a production-like machine for their development by insisting that they use docker to speed up development. How do you engage the application team in a way that helps them own their solution and use it, then deliver that automation to a broader ecosystem in a meaningful way?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter Habitat. With Habitat, your application team can define availability, upgrade, red/green deployments, and other application-level-concerns and package that &lt;em>with the application&lt;/em> and deliver it to their target environments. This means that Chef can focus what it&amp;rsquo;s good at: configuration management of the infrastructure. A habitat package can live as a docker container on a development machine, a minimal QA environment, or as a full-blown linux node which was also configured using Chef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to try to find the one solution that will solve all of your problems. Many times that leaves you doing &lt;em>a lot of work&lt;/em> as you try to solve a problem with a solution that was not meant to solve those types of problems. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s totally fine to have a solution to the application&amp;rsquo;s problems and a different solution for the infrastructure problems. As long as both solutions start with code, are tested early and often, and meet together very quickly, we can take advantage of their differentiated power.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This, to me is Habitat&amp;rsquo;s story and is what makes me so excited for its future and so happy that I&amp;rsquo;m a partner with Chef.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Disruption is Uncomfortable</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/disruption-is-uncomfortable/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2016 08:00:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/disruption-is-uncomfortable/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-disruption-is-uncomfortable.jpg" alt="Disruption is Uncomfortable" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The other day we were doing an urgent Chef policy update in our production environment. It quickly became clear to all that this was uncomfortable. I had written extensive documentation to explain, as I saw it, how interact with Chef within our system. The person who was assigned the task, however, wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to make much sense of my documentation. So we had an awkward back and forth where he was asking me for the commands he should run and I was telling him that he should know what he is doing when running those commands. It was all very uncomfortable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I talked to a colleague about it who reminded me: &amp;ldquo;Hey Michael, you&amp;rsquo;re doing something disruptive here, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised when it is…disruptive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh yeah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then calmed down, got another colleague on my immediate Chef team on a call, and we figured out a better way to bring people on board with the process. We didn&amp;rsquo;t get angry. We didn&amp;rsquo;t go to lunch and talk about how idiotic that other team was. We realized that disruption is uncomfortable, so we can empathize with that and help people along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think this has been a major part of my job: helping people through the discomfort of change that DevOps presents to their status quo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Premature Optimization</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/premature-optimization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2016 08:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/premature-optimization/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-premature-optimization.jpg" alt="Premature Optimization" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I was talking to a colleague the other day who is working on a centralized initiative that has the potential to do a lot for our organization. He&amp;rsquo;s excited. He&amp;rsquo;s going to meetings, &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/alignment/">getting alignment&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/funding/">getting funding&lt;/a>. In it all, leaders are asking him for a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-grand-vision/">grand vision&lt;/a> that will bring all the disparate parts together into a coherent whole. He delivered that grand vision in the form of a plan that would bring a set of solutions together to satisfy what all stakeholders are asking for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been in that situation myself in the past. It&amp;rsquo;s all very exciting. Every meeting you have has a sense of purpose and direction. You are &lt;em>finally&lt;/em> bringing this change to the organization that it so desperately needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, in the past, I&amp;rsquo;ve missed the reality that the only thing that is known is the next one or two things that need to be done to improve the current situation. The grand vision might be needed to bring the needed alignment and funding into the situation. But if that vision removes me from the stark reality that if I don&amp;rsquo;t act upon the improvement opportunities that stand before me &lt;em>right&lt;/em> now with a high level of urgency, I will not end up making the transformative change that I am promising to everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I might still deliver a tool. I might even declare &amp;ldquo;Mission Accomplished&amp;rdquo; as I do. But without a flow of improvements that have the regular engagement of all stakeholders, the tool or initiative is destined to have little effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People say it&amp;rsquo;s bad to prematurely optimize code. It&amp;rsquo;s just as bad to prematurely optimize solutions. Make your solutions fit the problem you&amp;rsquo;re facing today, and give enough vision to provide the direction needed to keep it going in the right direction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Promoting Cookbooks into a Private Chef Supermarket with TeamCity</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/promoting-cookbooks-into-a-private-chef-supermarket-with-teamcity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2016 08:01:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/promoting-cookbooks-into-a-private-chef-supermarket-with-teamcity/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-promoting-cookbooks-into-a-private-chef-supermarket-with-teamcity.jpg" alt="Promoting Cookbooks" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/">We want the ability to control&lt;/a> which versions of which cookbooks we rely on and that those cookbooks are available to us even if the author removes them from GitHub. In fact with &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11300840/how-an-irate-developer-briefly-broke-javascript">the recent craziness on dependency management&lt;/a> and after listening to &lt;a href="https://www.arresteddevops.com/availability/">an episode on availability on Arrested DevOps,&lt;/a> I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that this isn&amp;rsquo;t just for large organizations like mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So to protect ourselves from that kind of craziness, we have created a &lt;a href="https://www.chef.io/blog/2015/12/31/a-supermarket-of-your-own-running-a-private-supermarket/">private chef supermarket&lt;/a> that we host all dependencies on. Then in our policyfiles, we specify that private supermarket as our default source for finding cookbooks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first, to get us started, we manually uploaded the cookbooks we needed and got to working. Then as we scaled we got tired of people asking us to upload another version. On top of that we want to have a good, clean process for approving external cookbooks/code into our blessed environment. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we implemented it:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-synchronize-github-with-internal-git-server">1: Synchronize GitHub with internal Git server&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have an internal, corporately blessed git server we use, so we needed to get what was in GitHub into that Git server. For each of the cookbooks, we create a TeamCity &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Build+Configuration">build configuration&lt;/a> (that&amp;rsquo;s based on a &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Build+Configuration+Template">template&lt;/a>) that does just this with a simple &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Command+Line">Command Line runner&lt;/a> (that runs in Windows only at the moment):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="lang:default decode:true ">mkdir %Repository Name%.git
git clone --mirror %Github Clone URL%
cd %Repository Name%.git
git remote add stash %Stash Clone URL%
git push --all stash
git push --tags stash&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>There are three variables that are &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Configuring+Build+Parameters">defined as parameters&lt;/a> here:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Repository Name: the name of the git repository, like &lt;span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">chef-client&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Github Clone URL: the URL to clone the git on GitHub, like &lt;span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">&lt;a href="https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client">https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stash URL: the URL to push the code to internally&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I had to go into our internal Git server and create a repo with the same name as the GitHub one so something could be pushed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Configuring+Build+Triggers">schedule this to run every day&lt;/a>, and let it do its thing. If I got crazy I could make it run everytime there was a checkin on github, but the model doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to have immediacy to it. My repository internally will be reasonably up to date.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2-create-an-internally-approved-branch-based-on-a-tag">2: Create an internally approved branch based on a tag&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The next thing we do is create a new branch on our internal git server that outlines what we have code reviewed and have approved to be a part of our infrastructure. During the first setup, we first clone the repo on our local machine with the internal git server:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="lang:default decode:true ">git clone http://mycompanygitserver.com/chef-client.git&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Then we simply run these commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="lang:default decode:true ">git checkout -b mycompany-approved v4.3.2
git push origin mycompany-approved&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This creates our &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; branch, from which our promotion can occur.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="3-run-cookbook-build-just-as-with-other-cookbooks">3: Run cookbook build just as with other cookbooks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The cookbook build will run as I outlined in &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/chef-cookbook-builds-in-teamcity/">a different post&lt;/a>. The only difference is the VCS Root that I pull will be off of the &lt;span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">mycompany-approved&lt;/span>  branch created above.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="4-promote-cookbook-to-supermarket">4: Promote cookbook to supermarket&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Then I promote a cookbook to the supermarket using a TeamCity template that I use for all cookbook promotions, which is basically this command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre class="lang:default decode:true ">knife supermarket share %cookbook_name% "Other" -o .&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I had to ensure that the &lt;span class="lang:default decode:true crayon-inline ">knife-supermarket&lt;/span>  gem was installed on my build server (of course, configured by chef as well). Also I parameterized the cookbook name so this could be inside of a template that can be reused everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cookbook also has a &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Snapshot+Dependencies">snapshot dependency&lt;/a> to the cookbook build above, ensuring that it is only released to our supermarket when it passes the build. That keeps everyone honest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="5-merge-into-approved-branch-as-people-request">5: Merge into approved branch as people request&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>People will still request that we merge into the approved branch, which is locked down so that a smaller team can approve of the changes. We can use a pull request model to review and audit how this happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Doing it this way gave us the most control over which changes go into our infrastructure. It avoids the public supermarket alltogether, because we found that the packages posted on that server cannot be pushed to another supermarket. Even if that problem were fixed, this way is superior because it gives us the ability to code review and audit every dependency we have going into our system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Orchestration Maturity Model with Chef</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/orchestration-maturity-model-with-chef/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2016 08:00:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/orchestration-maturity-model-with-chef/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-orchestration-maturity-model-with-chef.jpg" alt="Orchestration with Chef" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>One of our &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/proof-of-concept/">earliest questions&lt;/a> about configuration management tools is how we would do orchestration with them. We realized early on that with chef the orchestration story was fairly weak, especially compared with something like &lt;a href="http://saltstack.com/">salt&lt;/a>. But chef&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/technology-partnership/">other benefits&lt;/a> outweighed the weaknesses so we moved forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole time though I was confused about why Chef hadn&amp;rsquo;t invested more in orchestration. Salt and Ansible has it as a first class citizen and Puppet was &lt;a href="https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/app_orchestration_overview.html">actively adding it to its product&lt;/a>. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; it until I listened to Julian Dunn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF9IATUask">excellent presentation&lt;/a> on it at Ghent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chef, as a company, is more interested in giving you what will work for you than giving you what you&amp;rsquo;re asking for. This is what makes them such a special partner for us. They&amp;rsquo;re more of a coach and less of an enabler. This has led me to think of orchestration as a maturity journey through three phases:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="phase-1-do-it-like-before">&lt;strong>Phase 1: Do it Like Before!&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first phase of orchestration will be to model how you have been doing things before. OK, I need to stop services, copy files, start services. That&amp;rsquo;s orchestration, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At a surface level this is fine, but it leaves out the edge cases that happen when you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a scaled infrastructure:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What happens when a node was down and didn&amp;rsquo;t get the message to stop, and then comes back up in the middle of your upgrade, and starts?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What happens when a new node is added at a time when  you&amp;rsquo;re not doing an upgrade? Are any of those orchestration commands critical to the node itself?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are you splitting configuration management between your configuration management tool &lt;em>and&lt;/em> your orchestration? If you are directly stopping a service, THEN running chef later, then your configuration management is leaking out of your system and into other places.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="phase-2-declaratively-manage-state">&lt;strong>Phase 2: Declaratively Manage State&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If we&amp;rsquo;re writing chef recipes and starting from the beginning with some infrastructure, why live with the limitations of Phase 1? Why don&amp;rsquo;t we solve this problem? Thankfully with a tool like &lt;a href="https://www.consul.io/">consul&lt;/a> we can solve the problem by making some subtle changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create a real-time shared data view of the state of your system (with consul, &lt;a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">zookeeper&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using this shared data view, define &lt;em>all&lt;/em> desired states of the system. So if you need to transition your web cluster from the states of: off, waiting, converged, set that in your key value store&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write your chef recipe to define the desired state (resources) that are compiled &lt;em>based on the desired state defined in the shared data view&lt;/em>. So you have an if statement that says &amp;ldquo;if we want this thing to be off right now, there is a service resource with action of ‘off&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write an orchestrator that manages the state transitions between nodes in the environment &lt;em>by updating the shared data view&lt;/em>.  With consul we can do a consul_exec on our nodes to force chef to run. Or take it even further. And the orchestrator itself can be written through chef.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This gives you a number of benefits over the earlier phase:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If a node isn&amp;rsquo;t there when the state changes, it checks in and converges to the correct state, immediately! You &lt;em>always&lt;/em> get the node at the right state in the process because they are sharing the latest up to date shared data view&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a node is added, it will also converge to the correct state. It checks in and catches up immediately. Now you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about adding nodes and coordinating that with upgrades; things will just happen.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All configuration management are belong to chef. Simple.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="phase-3-decouple-the-nodes">&lt;strong>Phase 3: Decouple the Nodes&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The unfortunate reality though, is that even after phase 2 you may not be ready for bursting and scale. In order for those capabilities to exist, you need to have services that are independent of each other. So it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter that your web tier is on a particular version and the database hasn&amp;rsquo;t caught up yet. The web tier should tolerate that reality. So you can then update them separately and not worry about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still think there is a role for real-time orchestration to happen in order to manage the portions of your infrastructure to go through a little at a time until all is upgraded. But the complexities of having to turn one layer off so another layer can do its thing should largely go away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately this is really up to the software design itself to facilitate. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s really a business decision on whether that infrastructure should be made burstable and thus truly cloud-enabled. In some cases, we&amp;rsquo;ll only get as far as phase 2. In others we&amp;rsquo;ll go all the way, but probably camp out at phase 2 while the software catches up. That&amp;rsquo;s the way it should be: let&amp;rsquo;s get there little by little. As long as we&amp;rsquo;re going in the right direction, we&amp;rsquo;re good.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chef Cookbook Builds in TeamCity</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-cookbook-builds-in-teamcity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 08:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-cookbook-builds-in-teamcity/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>As more and more teams are &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/">coming on board with Chef&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve began to standardize our pipeline and ensure that everyone meets quality gates for the infrastructure they are creating. This started with finally figuring out how to get &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/">Test Kitchen working with Windows&lt;/a>, then quickly migrated to getting it running in &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">TeamCity&lt;/a>. Our entire division uses TeamCity for configuration management, so it&amp;rsquo;s something that I needed to plan out carefully in order to make the Chef pipeline &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> like it&amp;rsquo;s a part of a team&amp;rsquo;s normal build process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With this in mind, we created a** Chef** &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Creating+and+Editing+Projects">subproject&lt;/a> _inside_ of each team&amp;rsquo;s _existing_ project. We want them to have ownership when Chef infrastructure breaks and to take action on problems, just as if the problem happened in their own software build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then created a** Chef Cookbook** &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Build+Configuration+Template">build template&lt;/a> at the &lt;Root Project> level that all cookbooks can use for their own builds. This template defines a cookbook parameter that enables the build steps below to know where the cookbook is in source.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="version-control-settings">Version Control Settings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re not really sure about how we approach testing at the moment when it comes to dependencies. If a cookbook is very young or if we are testing a lot of things at once, we might want to use relative path dependencies to other cookbooks. Or we might want to use data bags at some level. So we&amp;rsquo;ve decided on the build agent itself to mimic a chef repo and then test it that way. We do this &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Build+Checkout+Directory#BuildCheckoutDirectory-Customcheckoutdirectory">through a checkout rule&lt;/a>, like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>+:.=&amp;amp;gt;cookbooks/contributors
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This means that the contributors cookbook will go to the cookbooks/contributors repo relative to build working directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="build-steps">Build Steps&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="1-run-foodcritic">&lt;strong>1. Run Foodcritic&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We want to do Chef liniting first before we get into further testing, so we run &lt;a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/">foodcritic&lt;/a>. This is done simply by creating a &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Command+Line">Command Line runner&lt;/a> with the foodcritic command:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2016-04-15-chef-cookbook-builds-in-teamcity/run-foodcritic-1.png" alt="Run Foodcritic">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-run-rubocop">&lt;strong>2. Run Rubocop&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once foodcritic runs, we want to finish our cookbook linting with &lt;a href="http://batsov.com/rubocop/">rubocop&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2016-04-15-chef-cookbook-builds-in-teamcity/run-rubocop.png" alt="Run Rubocop">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="3-run-cookbook-unit-tests">&lt;strong>3. Run Cookbook Unit Tests&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge fan of &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html">ChefSpec&lt;/a> because I believe they mock too much out and end up not adding a lot of value. But I do think having at least one there that ensures that your code will converge is immensely helpful. It&amp;rsquo;s much better waiting the few seconds to ensure that code converges than the few minutes to wait for kitchen to tell you the same thing. So I put the step here:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2016-04-15-chef-cookbook-builds-in-teamcity/run-chef-unit-tests.png" alt="Run Chef Unit Tests">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Update: actually just before this published, I removed this. The Chef Spec unit tests required too much ruby expertise to be helpful. Plus people are working well with kitchen and learn to rely on it instead. So as of yesterday, this step was removed.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="4-run-test-kitchen">&lt;strong>4.&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>Run Test Kitchen&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>And now for the magic! I need to &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/">run Test Kitchen&lt;/a>. If I&amp;rsquo;m using vagrant, I need to have a physical build agent to do this on. &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/tutorial-for-test-kitchen-with-azure/">If I&amp;rsquo;m running azure&lt;/a>, I need to have some credentials set up on the build agent. All of that configuration is handled through chef itself, so at this point all I need to do is run the command itself:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2016-04-15-chef-cookbook-builds-in-teamcity/run-kitchen-test.png" alt="Run Kitchen Test">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kitchen test will do a create, converge, and verify. It runs through the whole process. And I&amp;rsquo;ve tested that if it fails, the build will fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="5-kitchen-destroy">&lt;strong>5. Kitchen Destroy&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If the above test fails, it&amp;rsquo;s important to not keep the virtual machine running. This is especially true if I&amp;rsquo;m using the azure runner. So at the end I&amp;rsquo;ll call kitchen destroy, and &lt;em>always&lt;/em> call it, even if the previous command failed:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2016-04-15-chef-cookbook-builds-in-teamcity/run-kitchen-destroy.png" alt="Run Kitchen Destroy">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="build-agent-setup">Build Agent Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I mentioned earlier, our build agents are set up through Chef itself, so configuration of them is easy. Since we are creating our Chef Projects inside of the product&amp;rsquo;s projects, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to mix their build agents with the chef ones. We keep them separated because we let each team have their own build agents that they manage. To solve for the mix, we add the** Chef** subproject set up above to our own Chef build &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Agent+Pools">agent pool&lt;/a>. Then in our template, we add a &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Agent+Requirements">build agent requirement&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2016-04-15-chef-cookbook-builds-in-teamcity/chef-cookbook-requirement.png" alt="Chef Cookbook Requirement">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our recipe for the build agent, we set this environment variable, so this limits our cookbook builds to only run on build agents on which our chef recipe has run.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="triggering">Triggering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Finally, we want to trigger this cookbook build whenever something in the cookbook is checked in. We do this through adding a &lt;a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Configuring+VCS+Triggers">VCS trigger&lt;/a> with the default settings to the template.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With the template in place, it takes about ten minutes to add a team&amp;rsquo;s cookbook to be fully tested and built within their own environment. It feels very much like a software build, which is fantastic for everyone because it reminds us that the infrastructure code we are creating is like any other code; it should be subject to automation just like the rest.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>chef-vault Tutorial</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-vault-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 00:00:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/chef-vault-tutorial/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-chef-vault-tutorial.jpg" alt="Vault Tutorial" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This week I researched &lt;a href="https://github.com/chef/chef-vault">chef-vault&lt;/a> and struggled quite a bit &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/chef_vault.html">with the documentation&lt;/a>, so I thought I would write a bit of a tutorial on the technology for those who are interested in quickly understanding how it might work for their organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-chef-vault">Why chef-vault?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/data_bags.html#encrypt-a-data-bag-item">Encrypted data bags&lt;/a> force you to copy the shared secret that is used for decryption to your infrastructure. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to take that secret file and nefariously decrypt the data from somewhere else without anyone knowing about it. Chef-vault makes this much more difficult by giving both nodes and chef server users expressed permission to decrypt certain data. With chef-vault you don&amp;rsquo;t have to share a secret file with all of your nodes. This is a step up that simplifies everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution isn&amp;rsquo;t without its drawbacks. The main one is if you add nodes, you have to rerun something on the server to get that node to be able to decrypt the data bag. With &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/vault.html">Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s vault&lt;/a> you get better control over that, and better lease management, and credentials creation. To me, encrypted data bags are an unreliable used car, chef-vault is a nice mid-size sedan, and Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s vault is like a luxury car.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So now that we know where the tool sits within our choices, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the basics:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setup">Setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To get started with chef-vault, have the latest &lt;a href="https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/">ChefDK&lt;/a> installed (0.12 or greater) and install the &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/chef-vault/versions/2.8.0">chef-vault gem&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">chef gem install chef-vault
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And then ensure you have a .chef directory that connects to a chef server.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="creation">Creation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Creating a vault is easy:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife vault create passwords root -S &amp;quot;policy_name:webserver&amp;quot; -A &amp;quot;michael&amp;quot; -J root.json -M client
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>For whatever reason the &lt;code>knife vault&lt;/code>  command doesn&amp;rsquo;t default to talk to a chef server. So to create a knife vault, you have to specify &lt;code>-M client&lt;/code>  at the end. Or you can make your life easier going forward by adding this line to your knife.rb:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife[:vault_mode] = 'client'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>For the command, I used this root.json:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>{
&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;mhedgpeth&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;password&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;myPassword&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s review the options:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Team&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Natural Alignment&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Natural Misalignment&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Development&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Faster Delivery of features&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Have to be engaged in operations, more &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; to do&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Operations&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Less fires, more consistency&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Have to learn a new skillset and be a beginner&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Security&lt;/td>
&lt;td>More consistency, compliance&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Automation can cause unknown vulnerabilities&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Business&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Faster ROI for development, lower cost for operations, and a scale model that works&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Takes ongoing investment in culture and tools&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>This uploads two data bag items to a data bag called &amp;ldquo;passwords&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;code>root&lt;/code> which has the data above&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;code>root_keys&lt;/code>&lt;/strong> which stores the metadata about which clients can read and edit this data bag (as you specified above in the search criteria and administrators list.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="making-it-even-more-secure">Making it Even More Secure&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://coderanger.net/">Noah Kantrowitz&lt;/a> helped me understand the vulnerabilities of the above approach using the &lt;code>-S&lt;/code>  flag. With that flag, you give the nodes the ability to define the criteria by which they are allowed to decrypt the vault. So if you say I want nodes that have &lt;code>policy_name:webserver&lt;/code>  to decrypt this data, all it takes is someone saying they are &lt;code>'policy_name:webserver'&lt;/code>  and they will be granted the keys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A better way to handle this is through specifying each node explicitly through the -A flag. So your command would be:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife vault create passwords root -A &amp;quot;michael,webserver1,webserver2&amp;quot; -J root.json -M client
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="viewing-a-vault">Viewing a Vault&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that we have created a vault, let&amp;rsquo;s view it:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife vault show passwords root -M client
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>which will output:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>id: root
password: myPassword
username: mhedgpeth
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>It lets me view it in cleartext because I am one of the administrators on the vault itself. If I want, I can even view it in JSON if you want to move the file to another chef server:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife vault show passwords root -M client -Fjson
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="viewing-encrypted-version">Viewing Encrypted Version&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To view the encrypted version of the vault, you can simply use the normal commands for viewing data bag, just realizing that the vault data bag also has a _keys one too:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife data bag show passwords root
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>and&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife data bag show password root_keys
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Will show you lots of encrypted goodness which I will not show. The keys is helpful to see what clients are connected to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adding-nodes">Adding nodes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Probably the weakest part of chef-vault is what to do when you add nodes. If you have an elastic situation this can be dicey, because when you add nodes, you have to run this command to generate keys for those nodes to read the encrypted data:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife vault refresh passwords root --clean-unknown-clients
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This updates the &lt;code>root_keys&lt;/code>  encrypted data bag with information on the nodes that now match the search criteria. So it&amp;rsquo;s  important to know that the nodes that can read a vault is a snapshot in time based on the search criteria, not a dynamic list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you aren&amp;rsquo;t using a search criteria, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add nodes to the administrators list itself:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife vault update passwords root -A 'newnode,newnode2'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="rotating-keys">Rotating keys&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You might want to rotate the key that encrypts the data in the data bag. The way this works is the clients use their own key as a private key to combine with the public key on the chef server to decrypt the data bag&amp;rsquo;s key. That key encrypts the real data bag. This command will change that key:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife vault rotate all keys
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="cookbook-development">Cookbook Development&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What use is a data bag without using it in a cookbook? To be able to deal with this data bag in the cookbook, include the &lt;code>chef-vault::default&lt;/code>  recipe in your runlist. Then you will have the &lt;code>chef_vault_item&lt;/code>  method that you can call like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>item = chef_vault_item(&amp;quot;passwords&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;root&amp;quot;)
password = item['password']
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Using &lt;code>chef_vault_item&lt;/code>  will make your cookbook more testable by test kitchen (see below).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="version-control">Version Control&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With data bags, we like to have a data_bags repository that we use to promote shared data and version control changes. This kind of thing doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with chef-vault. Instead you get a small team that can update the vault and then have them manually do it. This isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal, but secrets are hard and, as I wrote above, using a dedicated secrets management tool like Hashicorp Vault will keep you from that level of work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kitchen-support">Kitchen Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To make this work in kitchen, just put a cleartext data bag in the data_bags folder that your kitchen run refers to (probably in &lt;code>test/integration/data_bags&lt;/code>). Then the vault commands fall back into using that dummy data when you use &lt;code>chef_vault_item&lt;/code>  to retrieve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The chef-vault functionality is compelling enough for serious consideration. Hopefully this walkthrough will help you decide if it is right for you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Power of Precendence</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-power-of-precendence/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 08:00:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-power-of-precendence/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The other day I a friend and colleague was working on a central initiative and asking me for help. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any traction on this initiative because all of the people who would need to approve of this initiative kept bringing up more and more issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The groups were caught &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/all-or-nothing-changes/">in a common trap&lt;/a> of any change: let&amp;rsquo;s make &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-grand-vision/">the Perfect State that Everyone Will Adhere To&lt;/a>. The stakes of the whole endeavor are raised when we arrive at that point. Everyone is now thinking to themselves, &amp;ldquo;This is my last chance to have any say in how this works; I better get all my concerns addressed before moving forward with it.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/">In a large enterprise&lt;/a>, this means that there will be tons of meetings, tons of confusion, and a lot of wasted time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommended to my friend to use the power of precedence to his advantage. Don&amp;rsquo;t fall for the trap of making the Perfect State. Instead, find a team with a serious business problem that your solution will address. Use that team&amp;rsquo;s leverage within the organization to get your change operational. Repeat this process. Pretty soon you will have a lot of teams using solution, getting obvious value out of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this strategy, as concerns come along, the concerns are rightly within a business context and not some mental exercise. This keeps everyone focused on doing what we&amp;rsquo;re paid to do: increase profitability through increased efficiency, increased revenue due to faster speed of market, and lower risk. And, since you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this in the real world, as concerns arise, you can say, &amp;ldquo;Let me show you how we do it.&amp;rdquo; You have precedence on your side. This isn&amp;rsquo;t an ivory tower exercise. You&amp;rsquo;re not hopping from one visio document to another to get everyone on board before you try something out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re doing &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/">incremental experiments&lt;/a> which are leading you to increased profitability and lower risk. This is creating a flywheel of change for the organization, within which people can express their concerns and thus become a part of the process to greater profitability and decreased risk. This is what a functional change initiative looks like. Everything else, unfortunately, is usually theater.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Missing Compiler/Unit Test for Feelings</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-missing-compilerunit-test-for-feelings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2016 08:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-missing-compilerunit-test-for-feelings/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As technical people we become fascinated early on by &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">the&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/getting-things-done-action-plan/">numerous&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/">tools&lt;/a> out there that make our jobs easier. A compiler or syntax checker is almost an afterthought these days: of course you would want some guidance on whether your code was in compliance with the language before running it. Unit tests are the same way; if I can run something and get a good answer on whether it is OK &lt;em>before&lt;/em> I put it in a shared environment, then &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/">that will save me tons of time&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a similar tool for how people feel about you. A technical person can fall into the trap of looking at more technical-oriented clues to how people feel, but these often fall short:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Team&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Natural Alignment&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Natural Misalignment&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>

&lt;td>Takes ongoing investment in culture and tools&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>The first step in keeping this kind of thing from happening to you is to care about people. &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/technology-partnership/">Put them before yourself&lt;/a>. Follow the golden rule. &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-technical-asshole-curse/">Don&amp;rsquo;t be an asshole&lt;/a>. The second step is to understand and embrace the true value in what people think about you when you&amp;rsquo;re not there. You can&amp;rsquo;t control this part, you can only influence it. If they think you&amp;rsquo;re an idiot or an asshole, work to show them that you have their best interests in mind and that you&amp;rsquo;re growing. Are you including them when we are solving problems, so &lt;em>they&lt;/em> own it and won&amp;rsquo;t blame you in disgust if something goes wrong?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That approach is fraught with difficulty, especially for someone with a technical background. There is no compiler for it. There is no unit test. There isn&amp;rsquo;t even a clear answer on how people exactly feel about you. The only thing you can do is care about it and try to influence it positively. In technology, caring about this is so uncommon that it ends up going a long way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Technical Asshole Curse</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-technical-asshole-curse/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2016 08:00:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-technical-asshole-curse/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-technical-asshole-curse.jpg" alt="Technical Asshole Curse" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it happen over and over again, and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/all-or-nothing-changes/">I fight it in myself every day&lt;/a>. I call it the Technical Asshole Curse. We&amp;rsquo;ll illustrate the curse by following our friend Joe through his career.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s starts so innocently: Joe cares. He wants to make a difference. He reads up on the best way to do something, and stands up in the important notice and gives management a way out of this mess. Joe introduces test-driven development, or a better way to provision infrastructure, or &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef/">a great new devops tool&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People take notice. Joe then gets promoted. People start coming to Joe for help on all things related to his expertise. Joe is now the go-to person for that topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s important to stop here and note an important truth that Joe doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite get: Joe is respected and given praise because of his &lt;em>hard skills&lt;/em>, not his &lt;em>soft skills&lt;/em>. In other words, people think he brings value to the organization because of his knowledge and not because of how he treats people. In fact, if people were honest with Joe, they would tell him that they are often uncomfortable with how Joe treats them. Sometimes Joe gets frustrated in meetings and talks over people. Other times Joe answers emails with no empathy or understanding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Joe is unaware of these problems, because everyone is so enamored with the technical value that Joe is bringing to the table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Joe&amp;rsquo;s career grows, the business builds a team around Joe to insulate him from those who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get him: other teams, top management, and especially the customers. Joe doesn&amp;rsquo;t care and thinks this is a good thing. But this is not a good thing: Joe is surrounded by people that think Joe is an asshole and that it&amp;rsquo;s their job to keep that fact from hurting the business. Joe&amp;rsquo;s colleagues go home from work and talk about how much they despise Joe, but how there is nothing they can do about it because Joe is so valuable to the company. The more they feel trapped, the more their secret resentment toward Joe grows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what happens over and over again when people only find their value in their technical contributions and ignore their interpersonal contributions. It&amp;rsquo;s a curse that happens to good people who stand up and make a difference, but fail to properly appreciate that the difference they seek combines an excellent approach with a group of people who feel great about working together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Businesses will rarely tell people that they&amp;rsquo;re an asshole. Rest assured: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt86dc6EIoY">they will talk about it when the asshole isn&amp;rsquo;t present&lt;/a>. And many times the fix will do nothing to help the asshole get some help. Instead many times the fix will enable the asshole to become more of one, while the cycle of resentment and frustration descend into further and further depths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to be an asshole in technology. In order for your idea to get through, you have to care and you have to tell people that they are doing it all wrong. If you&amp;rsquo;re not careful, you end up thinking their feelings are an unnecessary detail. That will be so destructive for your career if you let it fester. Instead, take people to lunch. Find out what they care about and empathize with their problems. Let &lt;em>them&lt;/em> come up with the solutions and help them out. Make it OK to be wrong about stuff. In short, don&amp;rsquo;t be an asshole.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Feelings > Compliance</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/feelings-compliance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2016 08:00:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/feelings-compliance/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>On the surface, leadership looks like an exercise in getting as many people compliant with one&amp;rsquo;s vision and direction. A naive leader will find themselves forcing others to comply to their policies, their direction, their demands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A while back I was in a meeting with a colleague going over the particulars of how I was going to implement a particular project. He started coming up with what I thought were dumb requirements, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it would help things to fight him, so I dutifully wrote the requirements down and told him that I would implement them. We went back and forth a few times to make sure I had it, and I explained that I had it and that I was going to implement the requirements the way he wanted them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the outside, I was compliant to my colleague&amp;rsquo;s wishes. On the inside I was frustrated and wanted to exit the conversation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to dismiss how people feel when I work with them. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize that their feelings about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing are more important than how much they outwardly follow my direction. If I interact with people and they come away from it feeling respected, listened to, and excited about what is possible, then I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about their compliance. On the other hand, if they are compliant but secretly think I&amp;rsquo;m an asshole, then they will probably do whatever they can to do the absolute minimum and will be happy when I fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find it easier to &lt;em>start&lt;/em> with one&amp;rsquo;s feelings. How do you feel about this change, project, or challenge? What can we come up with together that will address some of those things? If we have that conversation, then they are less likely to be externally compliant yet secretly hostilite.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tutorial for Test Kitchen with Azure</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/tutorial-for-test-kitchen-with-azure/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2016 08:00:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/tutorial-for-test-kitchen-with-azure/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As I wrote in &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/">the last post&lt;/a>, Test Kitchen as one of the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">things that attracted me to Chef&lt;/a>. There was a problem, though: running Windows on virtual machines automatically is difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time trying to create a vagrant image &lt;a href="http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/creating-windows-base-images-for-virtualbox-and-hyper-v-using-packer-boxstarter-and-vagrant">using Matt Wrock&amp;rsquo;s excellent blog&lt;/a> as a resource, and haven&amp;rsquo;t quite gotten it there yet. Plus, if I go the vagrant route, people have to have powerful machines on which to run test kitchen. The more I worked through that option, the more I because discouraged and dismayed that this may just never work for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then I discovered azure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: I&amp;rsquo;m not a Microsoft fanboy. But there are some great advantages to going this route:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Through my Microsoft-friendly workplace I get a MSDN Subscription, &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits/">with which I get $50/month credit to use azure&lt;/a>. So this is free, and I can run test kitchen on not-my compute resources.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Microsoft by definition is going to get Windows images right. So I don&amp;rsquo;t have to fight it anymore. I can just use it. It just works, just like it should.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://stuartpreston.net/">Stuart Preston&lt;/a> wrote a plugin for me that gets anyone past the learning curve very quickly. With this plugin you don&amp;rsquo;t have to really know anything about azure to use it for test kitchen&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>These reasons are so compelling, this is what our teams will be going with in the coming months. It&amp;rsquo;s critical that everyone be able to run test kitchen easily, and azure gives us the best shot at doing that without a lot of drama.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Setting up was easy:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/msgulfcommunity/archive/2014/09/15/how-to-activate-azure-benefit-for-msdn-subscribers.aspx">Activate your subscription from your MSDN account&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/">Install the Azure CLI for Windows&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Follow the directions &lt;a href="https://github.com/pendrica/kitchen-azurerm">on the kitchen-azurerm main page&lt;/a> to set up a Security Principal, Tenant, Password, and configure it in your user directory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a simple cookbook, create &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/mhedgpeth/a70ef0a7edf01d9c7ed2">a simple kitchen.yml file&lt;/a> like this:&lt;/li>

&lt;tr>
&lt;td>kitchen converge&lt;/td>
&lt;td>does kitchen create if needed, will converge the node using chef&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>kitchen verify&lt;/td>
&lt;td>does create and converge if needed, runs the tests that you&amp;rsquo;ve written&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>kitchen test&lt;/td>
&lt;td>does everything: create, converge, verify&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>kitchen destroy&lt;/td>
&lt;td>don&amp;rsquo;t forget this one; it removes the resources&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>There you have it, go through those easy steps and you have Kitchen working with Azure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Test Kitchen: Required, not Optional</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2016 08:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/test-kitchen-required-not-optional/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-test-kitchen-required-not-optional.jpg" alt="Test Kitchen" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When I first started reading through &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">the Learning Chef book&lt;/a> I became quite fascinated and enamored by &lt;a href="http://kitchen.ci/">Test Kitchen&lt;/a>. The community created such a wonderful way to introduce testing into their workflow. That&amp;rsquo;s fantastic!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Integration and support of Test Kitchen was one of our reasons for &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/technology-partnership/">partnering with Chef&lt;/a>. We had a way to create a test-driven infrastructure, which would be essential to truly scaling our automation to fit our vision. But, I reasoned, for now we would leave it out of the picture so we can focus on the more important tasks like developing cookbooks and establishing a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/">change-management workflow&lt;/a> that fit our broader security model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I now see that I was looking at this all wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The choice to forego testing is a common one: teams often make sure then have a core idea that will work before they invest in testing. Then they pivot very hard into the testing direction when the core is there. This is the direction I took, largely because of how we couldn&amp;rsquo;t easily get Windows, Test Kitchen and vagrant to work together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I changed my mind when I recently tried to work with a group of 25 people to learn Chef. In the workshop I asked people to set up a virtual machine somewhere, copy stuff over, get it on a chef server (or run it in local mode directly) and then watched them struggle with the nonessential details and not get much done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reality then dawned on me: &lt;strong>Test Kitchen is the only efficient way to run your cookbooks.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s not for testing first. It&amp;rsquo;s for running first. If you are a developer, you&amp;rsquo;re used to coding a little and running a little. The reality all developers discovered decades ago is that &lt;strong>you&amp;rsquo;re not going to get very far with coding unless you are running your code frequently.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since chef runs on an infrastructure, it&amp;rsquo;s much more difficult to run. You have to run it on a virtual machine. This is what Test Kitchen is for.****&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using chef without Test Kitchen is like opening a restaurant and inviting everyone to taste the food without practicing with your kitchen staff first. No one would do that because it would fail miserably. The restaurant would spend a massive amount of time getting feedback on a product that they can&amp;rsquo;t trust is ready for external consumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So my next task is to get us up and running with Test Kitchen. I now know that it&amp;rsquo;s not just a nice tool for testing; it&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of coding with chef.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>All or Nothing Changes</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/all-or-nothing-changes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2016 08:00:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/all-or-nothing-changes/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-all-or-nothing-changes.jpg" alt="All or Nothing Changes" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy-ebook/dp/B009UW5X4C/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1452553054&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=feeling+good">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&lt;/a> has taught me the danger in all or nothing thinking. If I enjoy my job, perhaps it isn&amp;rsquo;t a good idea to work 80 hours at it. If I fail at work, then &lt;em>all is not lost&lt;/em>. If I want to lose weight, perhaps the best thing to do is stop eating cookies. Maybe if I try to limit my processed food intake to zero I will freak out and eat three boxes of Oreos from the store. All or nothing thinking is the single most formidable thinking error component in my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it&amp;rsquo;s only natural that I would fight it in change initiatives at work. When I get an idea for a change, I become obsessed. I read everything I can about it. I watch videos. I absorb the technology. Then I come up with a grand vision about how everything can be different. It&amp;rsquo;s exciting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if I sell people on &lt;em>that&lt;/em> grand vision, I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen into a trap by handing the opponents of the change a huge weapon. If what you&amp;rsquo;re selling is perfection (or &amp;ldquo;all&amp;rdquo; in this case), then all it takes is for someone to demonstrate how your tool can&amp;rsquo;t possibly solve all the problems that we have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If instead you&amp;rsquo;re selling that a change will create a measurable impact for some of our major problems and opportunities, of course, the change can be scaled elsewhere. But let&amp;rsquo;s not focus on that right now. Let&amp;rsquo;s make something work. Let&amp;rsquo;s show everyone that this is for real. Let&amp;rsquo;s avoid &lt;em>nothing&lt;/em>. But let&amp;rsquo;s avoid &lt;em>all&lt;/em>, as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to create the perfect utopia I will brag about to my grandchildren, I can solve real problems. I can be flexible with my solution architecture. I can be more flexible with tools. I can solve real problems and create a platform for even greater change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Change never happens in the single inspirational speech. It happens every day, little by little, one problem at a time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Power of Culture in Cross-Discipline Change Initiatives</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-power-of-culture-in-cross-discipline-change-initiatives/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2016 08:00:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-power-of-culture-in-cross-discipline-change-initiatives/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When I started my career, I was rewarded for &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">being creative&lt;/a>, stretching the boundaries, getting changes through the system to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/funding/">bring more revenue to my company&lt;/a>. I was a developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When my SecOps colleague started his career, he was rewarded for keeping people like me from destroying the business with poorly planned implementations that make us vulnerable to attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When my Operations colleague started her career, she was rewarded for taking the crazy ideas that the developer wanted to implement and translating them into something that &lt;em>will actually work&lt;/em>, subject to the rules that the SecOps person dictates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the natural state, we have all created value in our careers by trying to work around the flaws of the other groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To the developer, SecOps and Operations needlessly slow everything down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To SecOps, developers are dangerous and operations are unreliable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To Operations, SecOps are paranoid and developers don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I vastly underrated the power of these cultural scripts when first initiating our change initiatives around DevOps and automation.&lt;/strong> In fact, I mindlessly continued to follow my script. I went to SecOps with the attitude of &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s this awesome change I want to do that will change our business, please approve of it.&amp;rdquo; They followed their cultural script with the response of &amp;ldquo;oh look here is a developer who just walked in with a weapon that can wipe out our entire business.&amp;rdquo; There is no partnership there; there is only conflict. And unfortunately, conflict is what I began with. &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/">I&amp;rsquo;m still working to undo the damage&lt;/a> I did in those early days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of the attitude I learned as a developer, I should have taken an attitude of a business person: &amp;ldquo;What are the problems that are or have the potential to drag down revenue and increase costs, and how can I help fix them?&amp;rdquo; It turns out that SecOps and Operations both have extremely valuable roles and they aren&amp;rsquo;t getting in the way of my awesome developer changes. They have problems just like the rest of us, and if I take the time to understand them, perhaps we can partner and solve them together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of coming to SecOps to try to get approval for the tool, why don&amp;rsquo;t I start with their compliance challenges and how we solve those? If I can use a tool to get their system more compliant, then that&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em>better&lt;/em> baseline from which we can do some other great things, like configuration management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of coming to Operations to merely implement the tool, why don&amp;rsquo;t I start with the problems they are having and iteratively help them solve those problems? Instead of just relying on the development teams, maybe I should start going to the Change Advisory Board meetings and then show up when the deployment happens. Then after that I can follow up and say, &amp;ldquo;For a couple of days of work, we can automate that. How does that sound?&amp;rdquo; All of the sudden I go from being a &lt;em>developer who doesn&amp;rsquo;t get it&lt;/em> to &lt;em>partner who will make my life easier&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the cultural roles shift away from conflict and towards cooperation, magical things will happen. I&amp;rsquo;m working like crazy to make that happen right now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Overdependent Organization</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-overdependent-organization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2016 08:00:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-overdependent-organization/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Years ago we went to a small church that met in a boys and girls club in our city. At one point I was leading the music on Sunday mornings, running our new visitor/assimilation program, attending a small group during the week, and leading the youth ministry of 10-20 students. This all happened while I had a full time computer programming job, our first child was born, and we were contributing 10% of my pre-tax income to the church.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I eventually got tired of all of this and decided it was time to move on. Within a month the church ended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There wasn&amp;rsquo;t a banner saying, &amp;ldquo;Michael is leaving this church – we&amp;rsquo;re shutting down.&amp;rdquo; In fact the story is much different than that. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder what would have happened if I chose to leave a few years earlier. Would things have lasted so long? I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to think not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This experience has caused me to look at dependence on me in a different light. If I am &lt;em>the only reason&lt;/em> a project is staying afloat, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get out. Things that are worth doing don&amp;rsquo;t depend on one person to do them. They have followers, believers, excited people who will step up and fill in when you move on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I leave a project and see that it completely implodes, it&amp;rsquo;s a sign to me that I was shielding the organization from seeing the truth: that the initiative was fundamentally flawed and I was keeping it afloat. What I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to see is moving on from something that &lt;em>gets better&lt;/em> after I leave. I laid a foundation, and there was a true solution to a true problem that didn&amp;rsquo;t require my absolute attention. That&amp;rsquo;s the ultimate goal on anything I do at the moment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Proof of Concept</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/proof-of-concept/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/proof-of-concept/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a classic scenario: a group of people &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/dont-start-with-tools/">want to use a tool&lt;/a> but before they can, they do a proof of concept (or POC) with the technology as a means of showing that it will do what it says it will do. In the past the proof of concept was purely a technical issue: how does the tool act when working with the various use cases we&amp;rsquo;ve identified? We create a sandbox and show the value at a demo or two, then we&amp;rsquo;re ready to move forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to stop there. But I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to take things further. The proof of concept should include at least two other aspects beyond technology:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Culture:&lt;/strong> can you &lt;strong>prove&lt;/strong> (through an experiment or two) that the people who will be involved with the new tool or change will be engaged as expected? It&amp;rsquo;s nice enough to have the person who is excited about the technology get it to provide value, but can an average person within the organization?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Security:&lt;/strong> how does your SecOps team feel about this change? Are they on board with it or resisting it? Will they cooperate to the extent that they can put it in production in a limited capacity?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef/">our Chef initiative&lt;/a> both of these elements were concerns that were outside of the scope of our proof of concept. If I were to do things again, I would have put them in scope. That would have better clarified and added urgency to all elements that posed a risk to the change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A good test for a true proof of concept is whether you can get something running in production.&lt;/strong> If the answer is yes, then you are probably ready to go. If the answer is no, then watch out for what you&amp;rsquo;re buying and how easily you will be able to roll out the change you are promising.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building Alliances</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/building-alliances/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2016 08:00:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/building-alliances/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The other day I met with a friend and colleague about why a particular meeting went badly. The meeting was a few weeks back with a team that isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly thrilled about an initiative I&amp;rsquo;m championing. I knew this and basically did a demonstration of the proposed change, during which I was peppered with question after question. You know when you&amp;rsquo;re in a meeting and everyone is going along with it and the questions are constructive and getting everyone more excited about the possibilities? Well, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t that meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;m following up with this friend, and he&amp;rsquo;s telling me that I should have met with him and his team before I met with the more hostile team. That way he could have known the context of my proposal and jumped in with his perspective in a way that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it &lt;em>the team vs. Michael&lt;/em> but made it more of a discussion. It was as if I put my chess piece unguarded on the other side of the board; I&amp;rsquo;m going to get killed. I need to have alliances if I&amp;rsquo;m going to effectively persuade people, especially those more naturally hostile to my proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was reminded of this recently when I read through &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lnxchk">Mandi Walls&lt;/a> really great and short book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-DevOps-Culture-Mandi-Walls-ebook/dp/B00CBM1WFC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1452606188&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=building+a+devops+culture">Building a DevOps Culture&lt;/a>. She writes about the need to have a team of people around you that will help you roll out your DevOps initiatives:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This person, or team of people, will serve an important role, a combination of evangelist, tools expert, process subject-matter expert (SME), and buddy. They&amp;rsquo;re like your camp counselors. They&amp;rsquo;ll teach a little bit, answer questions, reassure the reluctant, and bring the marshmallows at the end of a long day. These folks are hard to find, and often aren&amp;rsquo;t who you think they are. The last person you want for a job like this is someone who&amp;rsquo;s smart but a complete jerk everyone hates but who happens to know how to use the tools. Find the people who everyone wishes were on their team, borrow some of their time, and form a working group to help other teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Mandi is right. At first I thought of myself as the champion of this thing. Then I very quickly met John who was better liked, more experienced, and more passionate about all of this than I am. John has delivered great results for both me and the company. He is so valuable to what we&amp;rsquo;re doing that I won&amp;rsquo;t use his last name, won&amp;rsquo;t link to his LinkedIn profile, and won&amp;rsquo;t even say whether I have changed his first name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>John is the type of person I want on my team. Going forward if I am going into a potentially hostile situation or into a group of people who aren&amp;rsquo;t naturally inclined to go along with what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do, I&amp;rsquo;ll surround myself with liked, credible people who are able to fill in where I can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Technology &lt; Partnership</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/technology-partnership/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2016 08:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/technology-partnership/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Last year our organization &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef/">made a major decision to use Chef&lt;/a> for our configuration management. People often ask me why we chose Chef over Puppet, SaltStack, or Ansible. I tell them that we chose Chef over the others because they have a better sales organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m only half kidding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe that the essence of success with change initiatives and tools is &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/dont-start-with-tools/">not about the underlying technology&lt;/a>. Chances are if you have a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/funding/">funded popular tool&lt;/a> it&amp;rsquo;s going to have some cool technology. All of the above was cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead the essence of success with change initiatives is managing the organizational and cultural changes needed to make it to the other side. Chef is a great partner in helping us navigate our change through the various parties and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/">into a model that rapidly delivers value for our business&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve been extremely impressed with their organization at all levels and don&amp;rsquo;t think I would be where I am without their help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So don&amp;rsquo;t start with the tools. Start with the people, the culture, the process that will lead to safe, repeatable, high-velocity change. If you find a tool that will partner with you in that discovery, you probably have a world-class tool. If you start with the tool and ignore the other things, you might end up with a cool tool that no one wants or understands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Before What</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/why-before-what/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2016 08:00:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/why-before-what/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Recently a colleague and I were talking about his team&amp;rsquo;s agile transformation. He is excited about what&amp;rsquo;s to come but was challenged to bring everyone together in a meaningful way that leads to the change he wants to see. We talked about the importance of starting with a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/who-is-with-you/">shared vision of a problem&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/">iteratively working toward a solution&lt;/a>. It seems easier to just start with the end: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going Agile!!!!&amp;rdquo; and watch everyone fall in line. Unfortunately it never happens that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was reminded of this while recently reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-DevOps-Culture-Mandi-Walls-ebook/dp/B00CBM1WFC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1452565552&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=building+devops+culture">Building a DevOps Culture&lt;/a> by  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lnxchk">Mandi Walls&lt;/a>. She writes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Proving change is necessary requires some legwork. It&amp;rsquo;s fine to want to change your organization because &amp;ldquo;everyone&amp;rdquo; is doing DevOps now, but you&amp;rsquo;re looking at months of work, new tools to learn and implement, teams to restructure. These costs must be outweighed by the benefits, so you have to be able to put real value on your processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Articulating upfront what your goals are will help you with other phases of your DevOps roll out.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is exactly the work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing related to Chef over the past year. Recently we started talking about improving monitoring as well. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to say, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going with New Relic!&amp;rdquo; Or, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going with App Dynamics!&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve resisted that siren song, though, to really dig into what the problems are and what specific solutions fit the problems. When the problems are clear and measurable, the solutions have alignment and buy-in, and funding is easy. Without those core components, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid the issue is doomed. So I&amp;rsquo;m following Mandi&amp;rsquo;s advice and doing the hard work up front to define a shared vision of the problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't Start with Tools</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/dont-start-with-tools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 08:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/dont-start-with-tools/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In the past whenever I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to solve a technical problem, the first thing I would do is &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">find the right tool for the job&lt;/a>. I would then test that tool against the known use cases, share it with others in the organization, and see if excitement warrants further consideration. If we&amp;rsquo;re spending a lot of money, the vendor will get involved and help push everyone toward a decision to go with the tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The phase is so exciting, so full of promise&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And often completely misguided.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of starting with the tool, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that I need to start with the business and the problems its leaders face. Once we all agree to the problems and have a clear, shared, measurable view of those problems, we can then determine the right tool for the job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I was in a meeting about &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef/">Chef&lt;/a> with a colleague who is not very interested in adopting Chef for his project. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t see how Chef fits with his operational goals for next year. He was talking about his main pain points being the a greater need for operational visibility into his entire stack of hundreds of nodes. So I asked him, &amp;ldquo;what if we helped you solve that problem with a greater focus on monitoring?&amp;rdquo; He paused and said to me &amp;ldquo;I thought this meeting was about Chef.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the meeting and discussion becomes about the tool, you&amp;rsquo;re no longer having the right conversation. Start with the problems, and find good solutions that fit those problems. Repeat.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Putting Developers On Call</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/putting-developers-on-call/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2016 08:00:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/putting-developers-on-call/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-putting-developers-on-call.jpg" alt="Putting Developers On Call" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Recently I read through the short but sweet book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-DevOps-Culture-Mandi-Walls-ebook/dp/B00CBM1WFC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1452554943&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=building+devops+culture">Building a DevOps Culture&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lnxchk">Mandi Walls&lt;/a>. In the book Mandi has an idea that I admit to having completely dismissed the moment I read it:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One of the early controversial aspects of what became DevOps was the assertion that Engineering should be doing on-call rotations. In fact, this idea was presented in a way that made it sound like your developers would want to be on call if they were truly dedicated to building the best possible product, because they were the ones responsible for the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My immediate reaction was: &amp;ldquo;that would never work for us.&amp;rdquo; Whenever I have that kind of reaction, it&amp;rsquo;s a red flag. Never use the word never. So I asked myself why, thought about it, and dug a little deeper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main reason this would be a challenge for us is that for compliance reasons &lt;a href="http://www.sans.edu/research/security-laboratory/article/it-separation-duties">we keep developers out of production&lt;/a>. So even if the developers were on call, they would not be able to do much because they couldn&amp;rsquo;t access production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So that&amp;rsquo;s a bummer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But wait, do they &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to access production to be on call? What if they were on call &lt;em>with&lt;/em> someone in operations that had the access. When there was an incident they could hop on to a screen sharing application and troubleshoot things together. In fact, this mirrors what happens when an incident is escalated: you have everyone get on a call and talk through an issue together, with operations having the power and control to make the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If our developers were on call, they would accept more responsibility for creating a great product. They would then see the outcome of their good or bad design, and improve on it. Operations would feel like they&amp;rsquo;re not on an island trying to make something work with no context. The good things that could come out of such an initiative surely outweigh the problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I&amp;rsquo;m sold on this being something that could help us, I&amp;rsquo;m now going to bring it up as something to try. It will be interesting to see if the idea has legs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who is with you?</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/who-is-with-you/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 08:00:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/who-is-with-you/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>There are three elements to every solution:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Knowing the problem well enough to know a few solutions and what you think is best&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bringing together everyone&amp;rsquo;s idea of a solution into one strategy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Execution&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to skip step #2. Why would you need that &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/surrounded/">if you are so smart&lt;/a> and already know the solutions?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is in order to &lt;em>really&lt;/em> do #3 you have &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/alignment/">to have alignment&lt;/a>. When you get to the end and have the solution, you should look around and see a crowd around you celebrating the accomplishment of &lt;em>their&lt;/em> problems with &lt;em>their&lt;/em> solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are solving this together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you try to solve alone you will quickly realize that you spent a lot of energy going in the wrong direction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Funding</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/funding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2015 08:00:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/funding/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We have a great idea. &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/alignment/">We have alignment&lt;/a>. Everyone is excited. This is the right change for our organization!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there isn&amp;rsquo;t funding for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wait! Someone says. We can work on it on the side. Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll make maybe a little progress on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, you won&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We work in a business that exists to turn a profit. There are two ways to do this: increase revenue and reduce costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those who have a compelling case that revenue will increase or costs will reduce will get the funding to pursue those objectives. It&amp;rsquo;s simple business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always use the funding question as a litmus test for viability of an idea. Are we willing to incur licensing and staffing expenses in order to create this outcome? If not then (1) I misread the cost or revenue realities of the business or (2) I didn&amp;rsquo;t properly sell them to the stakeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You see the true priorities of the business when you ask the funding question. This is why I never move past this question until it&amp;rsquo;s properly answered.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Whose Goals?</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/whose-goals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2015 08:00:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/whose-goals/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>There have been times where my goals were &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/planned-thinking/">clear, written, specific&lt;/a>. When that happens a whole range of possibilities exist. The power of specific goals always amazes me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other times I&amp;rsquo;m coasting with no goals. I&amp;rsquo;m just making it to the next thing and not really thinking about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to think that I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have anyone&amp;rsquo;s goals during those periods. A closer inspection reveals otherwise:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was meeting the goals of my more savvy colleagues that had clear goals themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was meeting the goals of Facebook or Twitter executives, for more page views, more advertising revenue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was meeting the goals of the Dallas Cowboys organization, for me to be a more engaged and thus more lucrative customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goals always exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My only choice is between having my goals or someone else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Surrounded</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/surrounded/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2015 08:00:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/surrounded/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Early in my career I was rewarded for knowing everything. People noticed when I interrupted, when I had the right answer. My boss took notice when I had the insight that he didn&amp;rsquo;t have at a critical moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The feeling of being the one that knows is so rewarding and addictive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that it&amp;rsquo;s so limiting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you grow your ability to know and recognize the problems and solutions grows. Code turns into design. Design turns into process. Process turns into strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have to be the smartest person in the room at all times, you will simply not grow into the later stages. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So find a new addiction: surround yourself with people who have the answers that you used to have. Take notice at the critical moments when others stand up and reward those who fill those critical needs. And enjoy the journey into new territory that you&amp;rsquo;re there to conquer: the strategy, leadership, and process that it takes for your team and organization to be successful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Inferior "Right" Way</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-inferior-right-way/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 08:00:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-inferior-right-way/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent much of my career trying to find roadblocks to technical and organizational success. This passion leads me to great tools like &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">TeamCity&lt;/a> and of &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef/">Chef&lt;/a>. My success in leveraging tools for organizational success leads me to be opinionated about what tools we should be using and how we should be doing things in our organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is so easily get locked into the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; solution that would &amp;ldquo;solve all of our problems.&amp;rdquo; Early on that worked just fine for me, but over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;ve grown with our organization from a newly acquired startup to a mid-sized company to a large multinational, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that doing the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; thing &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/alignment/">without alignment&lt;/a> with the key stakeholders is the wrong thing. It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to read a book and evaluate a tool like chef to see that it will solve our problems. It&amp;rsquo;s not even enough to talk developers into using it and seeing its value. One must do serious work to analyze the state of the business, find the pain points that are either preventing revenue or creating unnecessary cost, and then set a strategy for addressing those things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that, one finds the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way. After that, one finds the &amp;ldquo;tool&amp;rdquo; that they&amp;rsquo;ll use to solve the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone claiming to be the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; tool or solution before that analysis happens is likely wasting your time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alignment</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/alignment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2015 08:00:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/alignment/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>You can meet with the CEO of your company and craft an awesome strategy for taking your business to the next level, but if you do not have the agreement of middle management you have nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can meet with countless people on the ground who know the real problems, but if you can&amp;rsquo;t quantify it in the way that their leadership can understand, you have nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can read the greatest business book that lays out a superior path forward through industry best practices, but if you can&amp;rsquo;t join the solutions it promises to problems that are clear within your business, you have nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can craft a strategy with a respected leader in your organization to bring an initiative forward, but if her peers don&amp;rsquo;t see the value in the initiative, you have nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can even get an entire development organization rallied around a particular initiative, but if the sales organization doesn&amp;rsquo;t see that as adding value to its goals and the company&amp;rsquo;s profitability, you have nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Value isn&amp;rsquo;t found in leadership, books, best practices, departmental unity, or from those who do the work. &lt;strong>Value is found at the intersection of those things&lt;/strong>, where everyone sees the problem in the same way and will do their part in solving it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Security has been the most difficult part of &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef/">implementing chef&lt;/a> in my large organization. I recently spoke with Chef about this and had a great conversation with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dromologue">Justin Arbuckle&lt;/a> related to it. Chef is focusing this year on helping organizations like mine to achieve compliance at velocity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through the conversation and Justin&amp;rsquo;s great advice, I realized that every Chef initiative must have these three elements to be sucessful:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At first I was focused on the technology and what talked to what, which commands would be used, and how awesome the outcome would be for our business. From a security perspective, however, this was worthless. Security and compliance are focused on &lt;em>how we can safely make changes to this system&lt;/em>. This means that you don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally bring production down by a cookbook change. It also means that you get approvals within a defined process before making &lt;em>any&lt;/em> change. For us, this workflow didn&amp;rsquo;t really take shape until we decided to fully adopt &lt;a href="https://github.com/chef/chef-dk/blob/master/POLICYFILE_README.md">the Policy feature&lt;/a> and workflow for change management. We then wrote extensive documentation and visio diagrams to explain every element of every step in the journey from a checkin to a production change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until we had this documented and clear that we started making progress with our security team. The lesson we learned was: &lt;em>the technology is secondary to the workflow&lt;/em>. The workflow is most important. And, for you, if you&amp;rsquo;re security conscious and you haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at Policies yet, you really need to.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="make-it-real">Make it Real&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Looking back at the last few months of our implementation, we&amp;rsquo;ve spent way too much time in visio and not enough time creating a real environment in order to demonstrate the changes we&amp;rsquo;re talking about. I spent quite a lot of time trying to consolidate the chef ecosystem into something that someone could understand in an hour-long meeting, but that was ineffective. It turns out that: (1) chef is complicated and hard, that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s so powerful, and (2) people don&amp;rsquo;t generally have time to wrap their minds around it like I have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing what I know today, I would have started by creating an environment that demonstrated what I was talking about and then showed every stakeholder the workflow (defined above) applied to a real work situation that I could control. This is what we have done: we migrated YouTrack management to Chef and will demonstrate a secure, repeatable workflow to our security stakeholders with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will shift the conversation away from the abstract and into the implemented. It also means there are no unknowns to implementing the solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="empower-security">Empower Security&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Security people are used to hearing from people, &amp;ldquo;We want to do this cool thing that will make &lt;em>our&lt;/em> lives easier but will make &lt;em>your&lt;/em> lives more difficult.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s natural for them to  approach chef in the same way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, chef has made some amazing investments lately in features that enable a partnership with security rather than an impediment. The &lt;a href="https://www.chef.io/blog/2015/04/09/chef-audit-mode-cis-benchmarks/">audit mode features&lt;/a> recently released in Chef allow a security team to map the auditor&amp;rsquo;s implementation of the security compliance into actionable requirements that can then be applied to the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, all of the sudden, the crazy devops person who wants to make everything go faster is the person who will enable automated, reported compliance for PCI throughout our data center. The posture of the security group changes from being antagonistic into being a true partnership.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re planning on taking some PCI requirements and writing audit cookbooks for them. We&amp;rsquo;ll go into the auditing relationship with demonstratable proof that we are creating a more secure, auditable, and fast system for managing configuration in our hosted environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Empathy is probably the most important aspect of any change. Begin with how a change will improve the effectiveness of your colleagues and the ultimate profitability of your company. Security is no different. Thanks to my friends at Chef, I have a more solid strategy for meeting those goals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Discriminatory Wind</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/discriminatory-wind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 08:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/discriminatory-wind/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The other day I was &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/engineering-travel/">riding my bike&lt;/a> to work, felt great, and got there in 26 minutes. I usually take about 35 minutes to get there. My wife even noticed with &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/sanitize-your-smartphone-with-republic-wireless/">my automated location texts&lt;/a> that my phone sent her (Michael is leaving home, Michael is arriving at work). She sent me a text congratulating me on the great accomplishment. I even congratulated myself a bit on how regularly I bike now and how I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten so much better at this over the last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of the day, I started home. The wind was screaming in my face, and I could barely go over 10 MPH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the way home, I saw two bikers going in the opposite direction, cruising along happily. They looked at me with pity, thinking I was out of shape. I wanted to yell out, through the wind, &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t realize how good you have it!!!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost an hour later I was home. I was tired and beaten.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the wind is at your back, you go faster. You don&amp;rsquo;t realize it&amp;rsquo;s the wind that is pushing you; you think it&amp;rsquo;s you doing it. &lt;strong>When the wind is in your face, you are constantly reminded of the challenge and you constantly have to push.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are women I meet at conferences and work who have had the wind in their face and pushed through anyway and built successful careers. They meet countless people along the way who think they are better suited for more people-oriented professions like sales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At a recent conference, a lady in technology was checking out a technology at a sales booth. The person at the booth immediately raised his voice to a less threatening and gentle voice and then remarked about how surprised he was to hear that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t in sales herself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At other times women run into people who will mindlessly delegate the meeting notes, or the administrative tasks to them, because…there is no good reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Minorities within technology have the wind in their face and push through. I was horrified to overhear a white man at an event start talking with an inner city accent to an African American man about how he was going to go &amp;ldquo;all ghetto&amp;rdquo; on some technology and make it work, presumably, by not taking digital prisoners. The African American man politely acknowledged the awesomeness of this endeavor and quickly exited the conversation. I thought to myself, how many of these types of conversations does this person have to endure in places like this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re a white heterosexual male in technology, the wind is at your back. You may not notice it, but it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What to do for the others? My rule is that I will always treat others as people, never as labels, and keep my interest and conversation toward what can make them successful. I never bring up their status; they have enough awkward examples of that without me adding to it. But I also make an effort, in whatever way I can, to support, encourage, and respect those who have exhibited much more tenacity and courage than I have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Advice For Chef in Large Corporations</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2015 11:21:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-my-advice-for-chef-in-large-corporations.jpg" alt="Advice for Chef" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s my simple advice about &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef/">Chef&lt;/a> I wish I would have heard a year ago:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of the stories about &lt;a href="http://www.itskeptic.org/content/devops-unicorns-horses-and-mules">the unicorns, rainbows, and fairies&lt;/a> that are doing absolutely amazing things with configuration automation are extremely inspirational. &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/customizing-chef-book-review/">Read about them&lt;/a>. Learn about them. Enjoy their talks. Enjoy their hipster vibe. Tell yourself that you are going to be cool like that one day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then forget everything they are talking about. Because what they are doing is likely too advanced for what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, because you&amp;rsquo;re not five years or more into your infrastructure automation initiative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do this instead:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Create these four nodes in your Data Center, behind firewalls, with no outside connectivity whatsoever:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A Chef Server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Chef Client with the &lt;a href="https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/">ChefDK&lt;/a> installed on it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Chef Analytics Server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An Artifacts Server (like SFTP server)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Does your security team not allow connectivity between Production and UAT? Awesome! Build two environments! Does your security team segment audited environments from non-audited environments? Awesome! Build the above four servers in &lt;em>every segmented environment you have&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You heard that right. Now isn&amp;rsquo;t the time to get into pissing matches about your &amp;ldquo;new devops vision of greatness&amp;rdquo; that will totally transfor&amp;hellip;EVERYTHING! No, now is the time to automate the things. Set up your servers and make it happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this becomes political, then you are doing it wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>But Michael, how am I going to maintain all those environments?&lt;/em> Well, thankfully you have the joy and pleasure of (1) probably having a bad system in place which is why you are looking at Chef, and (2) Policyfiles. So get over your perfectionism and implement this easy workflow for change management:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/config_rb_policyfile.html">Use a policyfile&lt;/a> for every node in your infrastructure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Save changes to policyfiles into Git where each team has their policyfiles in their own git repository separate from their cookbooks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use your CI &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html#chef-install">to automatically generate&lt;/a> your policyfile.lock.json files and check them into Git.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use your CI to &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html#chef-export">to package each policy into a file&lt;/a> with the &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html#chef-export">chef export&lt;/a> command. This has all cookbooks, policy, everything.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+transfer+a+file+from+one+place+to+another">Get your updated policy archives to your Data Center&lt;/a>. You should be good at this. You do this already.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html#chef-push-archive">Activate your archives&lt;/a> on the Chef Server for the appropriate policy group with the &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html#chef-push-archive">chef push-archive&lt;/a> command&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s as easy as that. Have one or a hundred chef servers and you have those six steps above. You can save the absolutely mind blowing automation of step #5 and the simplification of everything later. That&amp;rsquo;s not the most important thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s most important: an application team deploys an upgrade with zero outages and zero problems. Then they brag to their leadership about it because it never went this smoothly when they did it the old way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notice nobody cared about a stupid security argument about what ports are open between environments (there are none in the above proposal) or trying to be &lt;a href="https://codeascraft.com/">like Etsy&lt;/a> or Netflix. People saw the zero outage and zero problems and people said to themselves, ‘Holy Shit This Is Real.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>!(Holy Shit This Is Real)[http://i.imgur.com/ON3nwXb.png]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Multiply the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://imgur.com/ON3nwXb">Holy Shit This Is Real&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; moments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to accomplish. Not a dream state. Not what a book said. You&amp;rsquo;re fundamentally transforming your organization&amp;rsquo;s ability to react to change, and that capability will be an absolute game changer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So get out of the politics, get out of the arguments, document and implement the simple strategy above, and watch perceptions of what is possible rapidly change.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intrinsic Motivators Leading to Chef</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2015 08:00:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-intrinsic-motivators-leading-to-chef.jpg" alt="Intrinsic Motivators" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m reading about culture in &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1LfPSL8">Lean Enterprise&lt;/a>, and the author makes the point that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc">bonuses aren&amp;rsquo;t the most effective means of motivating employees&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>While extrinsic motivators such as bonuses are effective in&amp;hellip;mechanical work, they actually &lt;em>reduce&lt;/em> performance in the context of knowledge work. People involved in nonroutine work are motivated by intrinsic factors summarized by Dan Pink as:&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>1: &lt;em>Autonomy:&lt;/em> the desire to direct our own lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>2. &lt;em>Mastery:&lt;/em> the urge to get better and better at something that matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>3. &lt;em>Purpose:&lt;/em> the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think this does a really great job of describing what my intrinsic motivators are for &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/" title="Learning Chef Book Review">rolling out Chef&lt;/a> in our organization. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;d love to be compensated well for doing what we are doing and would never argue to the contrary. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen though in the past that money is just money and there are things that matter to me as much or more than money. Daniel Pink really hits the nail on the head about what those are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Autonomy:&lt;/strong> providing this capability to my company will create more of an ability to direct my own path in the future. The more value I help create, the more I can be in control on how I express that value, and the more freedom I&amp;rsquo;ll have, within the context of a team, to solve problems that interest me.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mastery:&lt;/strong> here is something that I can master: how to automate infrastructure configuration management through code using chef. This is something that can scale quite large, and I have the ability to become one of a few people in the organization that has a full handle on it. That&amp;rsquo;s exciting to me! I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be mediocre or have a skill that everyone else views as a commodity.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Purpose:&lt;/strong> this is the biggest intrinsic motivator for what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. People who do configuration management today have chaotic lives and regularly stay up all hours of the night to perform their duties manually. I get to change that! Our customers don&amp;rsquo;t yet have the uptime and consistency that they expect and deserve. I get to help change that, and create a game-changing strength for our organization compared to our competitors.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m excited about this journey that I&amp;rsquo;m on. The motivators are far more intrinsic than extrinsic. I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that is why they are so powerful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kanban Prioritization with Cost of Delay</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/kanban-prioritization-with-cost-of-delay/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2015 08:00:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/kanban-prioritization-with-cost-of-delay/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-kanban-prioritization-with-cost-of-delay.jpg" alt="Delay" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We have established an &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/defining-the-kanban-input-queue/">input queue&lt;/a> and defined &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-one-metric-that-matters/">the one metric that matters&lt;/a> for our Kanban project. Our standups are &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/kanban-standup-meetings-a-way-out-of-standup-hell/">more focused than ever before&lt;/a>. Now we need to focus on how to prioritize items that go into our input queue. &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1LfPSL8">Lean Enterprise&lt;/a> outlines an interesting way of doing this: prioritize items by their cost of delay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On an immature product, you might prioritize in order of who is screaming the loudest. This creates an unhealthy competition among stakeholders to see who can be the most dramatic when asking for a change.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slightly more mature projects might look to the Hippo: the highest paid person&amp;rsquo;s opinion. This can lead to a strategy that is out of touch with what customers want, because the highest paid person usually talks only to other highly paid people and their direct subordinates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A functional Kanban project looks to return on investment. How much money will we get from this endeavor, and how quickly will we pay off the cost to create the change?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is great, but the problem comes about in software when you have a lot of options on the table that would have a healthy return on investment. &lt;em>What then?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is when the cost of delay calculation comes in handy. From &lt;em>Lean Enterprise:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To use Cost of Delay, we begin by deciding on the metric we are trying to optimize across our value stream. For organizations engaged in product development, this is typically lifecycle profit…When presented with a decision, we look at all the pieces of work affected by that decision and calculate how to maximize our One Metric That Matters given the various options we have. For this, we have to work out, for each piece of work, &lt;strong>what happens to our key metric when we delay that work&lt;/strong> (hence, &amp;ldquo;cost of delay&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Tomorrow morning I&amp;rsquo;m meeting with stakeholders for one of my projects and will prioritize tasks with this in mind. The project is focused on adding quality to our products, so the one metric that matters for this project is the rate of adoption of new features by our customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in mind we&amp;rsquo;ll have a few options:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>we can  invest in a large, new feature that we have evidence has prevented higher adoption&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we can work on decreasing the defect rate of the automation effort itself, as there are currently more defects being reported than there are being fixed within the automation product itself&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we can enhance the automation application by adding an undo feature which will make people more efficient at creating automated scripts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These are all important feature requests. I can name individuals who would choose a different answer as to the most important. When evaluated through the cost of delay paradigm, however, things become clear:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Team&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Natural Alignment&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Natural Misalignment&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Development&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Faster Delivery of features&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Have to be engaged in operations, more &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; to do&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Operations&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Less fires, more consistency&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Have to learn a new skillset and be a beginner&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Security&lt;/td>
&lt;td>More consistency, compliance&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Automation can cause unknown vulnerabilities&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Business&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Faster ROI for development, lower cost for operations, and a scale model that works&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Takes ongoing investment in culture and tools&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Doing this exercise makes it clear to me what our next priority should be. It will be interesting to see if the cost of delay method can be easily understood and adopted by others. We are early in our adoption of Kanban, so we are building this ship as we sail it. I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ll see soon enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Four Questions for Product Management</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/four-questions-for-product-management/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2015 08:00:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/four-questions-for-product-management/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-four-questions-for-product-management.jpg" alt="Questions for Product Management" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As product managers, how do we arrive at delighting customers? There are &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/mission-command/" title="Mission Command">organizational&lt;/a> and (/is-continuous-delivery-needed-in-our-organization/) that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned through the &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1utrIYL">Lean Enterprise&lt;/a> book, like finding the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-one-metric-that-matters/">one metric that matters&lt;/a>. These flow into team-level initiatives that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned through the &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1CcuYsg">Kanban book&lt;/a>, like &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/defining-the-kanban-input-queue/">defining an input queue&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/kanban-standup-meetings-a-way-out-of-standup-hell/">structuring your standups in a better way&lt;/a>. But I believe the fundamental change agent lies in how a product manager approaches requirements analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe requirements analysis boils down to four fundamental questions. The maturity of the team is dependent on which of these questions are being asked. This is in order from lower maturity to higher maturity, but they are all essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What do you want to do?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s essential to really understand what people want and make sure you understand exactly what&amp;rsquo;s being asked. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the situation multiple times where a change was asked, but when I asked probing questions about the exact desired behavior, the request fell apart. Also it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand what&amp;rsquo;s being asked for so we don&amp;rsquo;t deliver the wrong thing with the same name. It&amp;rsquo;s a terrible feeling to declare victory on something when celebrating with the development team to realize that the requestor is not equally celebratory of what you just did because it was the wrong thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the foundational question. You have to undertstand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why do you want to do that?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the question many people don&amp;rsquo;t get to. The thought is that a customer knows what they want and why is their business. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the years that this can be dangerous. If we don&amp;rsquo;t understand &lt;em>why&lt;/em> they want what they are asking for, then how can we know we are delivering the right thing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen time and time again the scenario I like to call** Declare Victory Yet Nothing Changes** scenario. This is where you do what was asked for, but the outcome everyone was looking for doesn&amp;rsquo;t materialize. But it&amp;rsquo;s easy to declare victory in that situation since you did indeed do what was asked for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without asking this second question, you&amp;rsquo;ll be lost in not being able to empathize with your customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How will this make you more successful?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a difficult question to ask without sounding condescending, because sometimes the answer seems obvious. The crux of this question is: how do you define success? The requestor should be able to explain that and in addition tie the request to this definition of success. This makes everything clearer. The customer might say something like, &amp;ldquo;I want to speed up service to increase revenue,&amp;rdquo; and want a feature to enable that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s where we want to be. We want to have a clear definition of our goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How can we measure success?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the tough part, but it&amp;rsquo;s a key element I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from the lean literature I&amp;rsquo;ve read recently. If you can&amp;rsquo;t measure something, you can&amp;rsquo;t manage it. We need to define success and create a measurement that will get us close to that. We then tie our product development strategy to the measurement of success and iteratively create new capabilities that are shown to influence our success metric. This is the essence of the Lean Startup Cycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently discovered the second two questions and they have made a world of difference. You are much more efficient in achieving your goals when you have defined shared success and have found a way to measure it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Apply Kanban to a Large Project with High Feature Variability</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/how-to-apply-kanban-to-a-large-project-with-high-feature-variability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Mar 2015 08:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/how-to-apply-kanban-to-a-large-project-with-high-feature-variability/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I was introducing some ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve learned recently about &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/initial-tracked-metrics-for-kanban-adoption/">throughput management&lt;/a> to a friend of mine who is on a large project. The question came up, how to make throughput a useful metric when there are some very small features that go through the system and others that can take months with a large team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s review a bit: throughput is the measurement of number of items you process through a system over a period of time. So you would say that you did fifteen features and bugs last month, and ten the month before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you had no control or process in place to deal with the fact that a new customer might want its killer feature, which is months of work for you, then this metric will quickly become meaningless. What to do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a simple way to handle this and a complicated way. I suppose the complicated way will be what&amp;rsquo;s needed for my friend&amp;rsquo;s project, but the simple way is good enough for my project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Simple Way: Break Things Down into MMFs&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a simpler project, you can simply break a large request down into a &lt;a href="http://www.netobjectives.com/minimum-marketable-features-mmfs-explained">Minimal Marketable Feature&lt;/a>. The team asks the question, what is the minimal value we can deliver to the customer in a way that they both understand it and accept it as adding value to them? It&amp;rsquo;s not something like &amp;ldquo;the database column is added to the database&amp;rdquo; but it&amp;rsquo;s also not &amp;ldquo;your killer feature is delivered.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you break things down into outcomes that the customer cares about, you end up with a lot of smaller issues and variability is much smaller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what I would try first. But what if that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work? What if the customer doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about your breakdown and just wants the feature?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Complicated Way: Break Epics into Stories&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more complicated way I got from &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1GgXlcU">the Kanban book&lt;/a> is to continue to allow the customer to define things &lt;em>their&lt;/em> way. Those items, when they are too big to break down, are called Epics and won&amp;rsquo;t be counted as throughput. The Epics are broken down into stories that are still testable outcomes. In other words, we are still avoiding the &amp;ldquo;database column is added&amp;rdquo; story. Your throughput metric will track the number of stories that are processed through the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen mixed success from teams that are trying to break things down. People tend to want to break things down into layers and not into testable outcomes for end users. Once that skill is mastered, however, the team has a good way to track throughput through the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>But what about Story Points?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another way to track throughput is through story points. I don&amp;rsquo;t like this. I&amp;rsquo;ve read evidence that when velocity by story points are managed to increase, the team simply begins to increase their story point estimates. We want to make sure we manage elements of the system that cannot be doctored, either subconsciously or consciously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also the Kanban book adds to the disdain of story point estimates by bemoaning the waste associated with getting an entire team together for the estimation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the exercise to measure throughput starts with ensuring that items flowing through the system are of a predictable size. Either way above would work, even for my friend on the large, established project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Initial Tracked Metrics for Kanban Adoption</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/initial-tracked-metrics-for-kanban-adoption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 08:00:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/initial-tracked-metrics-for-kanban-adoption/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>One of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve read through &lt;a href="http://www.djaa.com/">David Anderson&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1ywImb4">Kanban book&lt;/a> is the need for metrics. I was inspired by &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1CEMvHL">Lean Enterprise&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-one-metric-that-matters/">become more metric-driven&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/">make measurement&lt;/a> more of the foundation of my management approach. Anderson did not disappoint. He devotes a whole chapter to which metrics to track on an
&lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/kanban-decoupling-input-cadence-from-delivery-cadence/">initial Kanban initiative&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cumulative Flow&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kanban is focused on limiting work in progress to create flow, so it&amp;rsquo;s only natural to create a cumulative flow diagram. This should tell us a lot about the nature of flow in the project. Here is one from a recent release from &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/">YouTrack&lt;/a> that I only looked at today:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2015-03-16-initial-tracked-metrics-for-kanban-adoption/cumulative.png" alt="Cumulative Flow Diagram in YouTrack">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see that we had a lot in Ready for QA and nothing flowing to &amp;ldquo;Done&amp;rdquo;. But then at the end of the release, many of them drop off. Did they go to the next release? Why? Why weren&amp;rsquo;t they finished? The Developing features were staying constant, so it looks like that isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem. The analysis is bunched up at the start of the release, but isn&amp;rsquo;t occurring toward the end of the release. Is this a problem? There are so many actionable ideas that are coming out of viewing this chart. For now on, this chart will be at the forefront of any metrics my teams provide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lead Time&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a Kanban system, lead time is important because it is the basis of actions in the system. If the lead time is 20 days, you&amp;rsquo;re asking your stakeholders the question, &amp;ldquo;What X items will you want 20 days from now?&amp;rdquo; Also, when determining whether something needs to be rushed through a system, we &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to know lead time. In other words, if a stakeholder needs something in 30 days, is it possible? Without a lead time metric, that&amp;rsquo;s not known.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anderson stresses the importance of lead time distribution over mean lead time, because it will help the team understand the certainty with which commitments can be made. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to generate lead time from YouTrack, but I created a mock one in Excel fairly easily:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2015-03-16-initial-tracked-metrics-for-kanban-adoption/lead-time-distribution.png" alt="Lead Time Distribution">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tells us that we can easily promise a lead time of 10 days on the project. Many items will go much faster than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Throughput&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughput is the measurement of how many items go through the system over a fixed period of time, usually months. Ideally throughput should be high. Here is the throughput on one of my projects from the last part of 2014:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2015-03-16-initial-tracked-metrics-for-kanban-adoption/throughput.png" alt="Throughput">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tells us that there was a huge spike of productivity in October. Why was that? To be honest, it was because there was an important deadline to meet and I worked overtime on the project to get it done. Another observation from this data is that throughput is by no means consistent. Why is this? It can probably be seen in the cumulative flow diagram above if we view it for all months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Continuous improvement goals should be to increase throughput.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Initial Quality&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We want to make sure we don&amp;rsquo;t motivate the team to speed up without regard for quality issues they are creating. So we need quality to be one of our core metrics. Anderson talks about the metric being defects per feature, but I disagree. I want to just track straight defects that are found by customers:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2015-03-16-initial-tracked-metrics-for-kanban-adoption/defects-found.png" alt="Defects Found">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wow, October was busy! This makes me wonder whether all that productivity was worth it. November and December trended downward (but there was vacation in those months as well).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good metric is one that initiates action, and, as you can see here, these metrics are a great start to seeing the health of a project and ideas for improvement. They will be the basis of project management going forward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kanban Decoupling Input Cadence from Delivery Cadence</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/kanban-decoupling-input-cadence-from-delivery-cadence/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 08:00:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/kanban-decoupling-input-cadence-from-delivery-cadence/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-kanban-decoupling-input-cadence-from-delivery-cadence.jpg" alt="Decopuling Input Cadence" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>For my entire career, I have approached software development project planning at the level of the release. In waterfall, you plan a six month release, the first phase of which is to design and estimate the requested features to determine how much can go into the release. You are supposed to plan the whole thing. In Scrum, you plan a three week release up front. The cadence is shorter, but the process very similar. &lt;a href="http://www.djaa.com/">David Anderson&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1yaDiHw">Kanban book&lt;/a> provides another approach that separates &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/defining-the-kanban-input-queue/">the input process&lt;/a> from the output process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Kanban, the input queue is largely there to serve the development machine. You want to have as many items in the queue as are needed to not have anyone waiting for new work. On a typical small team, that is probably five items. A product manager would manage this queue by creating a regular meeting for all stakeholders to collectively decide what needs to happen next. Anderson recommends that the meeting happen once a week. If the product is processing work at an agile pace, this should be enough to refill the most important 2-3 items.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to think that this means that there should be weekly releases. When you step back and think about it, the release cycle has its own set of constraints. Remember that the input queue&amp;rsquo;s function is to provide the development team with the most valuable items to do next. The function of the delivery is to provide that value to the customers while minimizing delivery costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s say delivery of the software means that thousands of people need to be trained, materials need to be printed, and a marketing program needs to kick off. In this situation, the fixed costs of the delivery are high and thus it is desirable that they not happen as frequently. Can you imagine doing such a release every two weeks? That would be insane!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, delivery of the software might be very cheap because of tools &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">like chef&lt;/a> and training is built into the product. In this case, it makes sense to release more often. Perhaps a daily release would be a great idea for this type of team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A part of the lean movement focuses on taking a situation like the former one and turning it into the latter one. Lowered fixed costs of release means that value can flow more freely to customers, and ROI happens quicker. But that&amp;rsquo;s a strategic choice. At the beginning, you get the release cycle you get, and continuously improve to a better one. But because we have decoupled the input side of the equation, we get a team that is focused, flowing the highest priority work quickly through the system. I think that this will be a gamechanger for how my teams do product management going forward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning from Ebola Healthcare Workers with Enterprise Problem Solving</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/learning-from-ebola-healthcare-workers-with-enterprise-problem-solving/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2015 09:30:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/learning-from-ebola-healthcare-workers-with-enterprise-problem-solving/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In a large enterprise it can be difficult to implement large meaningful change. On many days I have ended up frustrated while sitting down to a margarita during &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/">one of my quarterly retrospectives&lt;/a>. How do I get through all the opinions and politics to create real, lasting change? After reading about &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-lean-startup-cycle/">the Lean Startup Cycle&lt;/a>, I have a new way of thinking about it, which starts with healthcare workers in West Africa &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/news/international/21625813-ebola-epidemic-west-africa-poses-catastrophic-threat-region-and-could-yet">fighting Ebola&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When these brave individuals arrive to risk their lives and help others, they are met with a striking contrast to the first world. As you have probably learned, there are entire tribes of people in West Africa who celebrate the recently deceased within an elaborate ceremony where the entire tribe drinks after the deceased loved one in a shared cup. Science certainly had nothing to do with it, but science does tell us that when the deceased person has Ebola, this is a surefire way of getting the whole village infected. Couple this with the cultural norm that those who are sick should travel large distances to medicine men who will heal them, and you have an epidemic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, faced with such a terrible situation of men, women, and children dying every day due to a horrible disease, what do I imagine is the reaction of these healthcare workers? Do they pound their fists and whine, &amp;ldquo;We could change this situation if these people weren&amp;rsquo;t being so &lt;em>stupid?&amp;quot;&lt;/em> Do they clock in and out, thinking that the problem is just too large and that they will just collect a paycheck so that they can support their family? In other words, is their primary approach to the situation that of &lt;em>frustration&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think they certainly feel frustration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, these people are professional scientists, and they probably follow &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">a much different formula&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>First, they start with a hypothesis.&lt;/strong> They ask themselves, maybe if we visit the tribal leaders we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to convince them that this practice is dangerous and that will stop the spread of this disease. If the leaders cannot be convince, then they may say that the tribes are a lost cause and that maybe they should lock down the entrances to the cities. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are hundreds of ideas that they come up, all without despair, but with a genuine hope that something can be done to improve the situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Next, they test the most promising hypothesis.&lt;/strong> The team may decide to educate the tribal leaders. They then create a short-term way to test their hypothesis. They decide to go to one village and talk to the tribal leaders then pay an informant to record the activities of the next funeral, which is likely to happen in the coming days. They try this with ten villages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Finally, they measure the results of the test.&lt;/strong> Out of the ten villages, only two changed their practices. While many of us might view this as a failure, the scientists see this as success. We now know what &lt;em>wouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> be helpful. Now we can come up with a better hypothesis and start the process all over again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method is what got us technology, medicine, and progress. &lt;strong>Why aren&amp;rsquo;t we using it in the enterprise?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kanban Standup Meetings: A Way Out of Standup Hell?</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/kanban-standup-meetings-a-way-out-of-standup-hell/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2015 08:00:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/kanban-standup-meetings-a-way-out-of-standup-hell/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-kanban-standup-meetings-a-way-out-of-standup-hell.jpg" alt="Kanban Standup" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In every Agile project, you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to have a daily standup meeting to facilitate communication and collective ownership. Intentions are always great at the beginning, but for me they have always descended into a tolerable mess. Can the &lt;a href="defining-the-kanban-input-queue/">Kanban method&lt;/a> teach us anything about how to do them better?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum">If you&amp;rsquo;re following the Scrum process&lt;/a>, the meeting should last 10-15 minutes and everyone should go around the room talking about what they accomplished yesterday, what they plan on doing today, and what, if anything, is blocking them. Every software development methodology I have read tells you to do them; I&amp;rsquo;ve even seen people have success with them on waterfall projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone is excited about doing the standups correctly, and then someone gets tired and &lt;a href="http://www.batimes.com/articles/seven-common-mistakes-with-the-daily-stand-up-meeting.html">everyone sits down&lt;/a>. Eventually what tends to happen on my team is that everyone reports to &lt;em>me&lt;/em>, the leader, what they intend on doing today and I give them about 10-30 seconds of comment to help them along. While I&amp;rsquo;m engaging with each person, the others are thinking about other things. There is no collective ownership.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is by no means a functional standup meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What to do about this? &lt;a href="http://www.djaa.com/">David Anderson&lt;/a> has some suggestions in his &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1yaebV5">Kanban book&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The need to go around the room and ask the three questions is obviated by the card wall. The wall contains all the information about who is working on what. Attendees who come regularly can see what has changed since yesterday and whether something is blocked or is not visually evident. So standups take a different format with a Kanban system. &lt;strong>The focus is on the flow of work.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve done these types before, and it is very effective. The question is now, &amp;ldquo;What needs to happen today to move things forward?&amp;rdquo; and everyone participates. This becomes an obvious group exercise, not a task reporting meeting to management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in the new standup, you start with the board on the right side and talk about every card. The team collectively identifies the actions taken that day to move it forward. Items that are blocked are highlighted and the team plans for a course of action. While it is driven by a leader, the person driving it can change and everyone is engaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also this way of doing standups scales well. Anderson writes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Daniel Vacanti ran a successful standup with more than 50 people at a project at Corbis in 2007 where, despite the large size of the team, the meeting was completed in around 10 minutes every morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A ten minute meeting with fifty people; that&amp;rsquo;s amazing! I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to getting my standups out of standup hell.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Defining the Kanban Input Queue</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/defining-the-kanban-input-queue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2015 10:00:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/defining-the-kanban-input-queue/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-defining-the-kanban-input-queue.jpg" alt="Defining the Input Queue" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I have been reading &lt;a href="http://www.djaa.com/">David Anderson&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a> wonderful book on &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/14OSLBa">Kanban&lt;/a> this week as a means to get more specific on the project improvements I want to make based &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-one-metric-that-matters/">on what I&amp;rsquo;m learning&lt;/a> with &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1y9Xjhh">Lean Enterprise&lt;/a>. This book has disrupted up my approach to backlog management and prioritization. Within a Scrum or Waterfall process, whenever a customer asks for a request, you put it on a list and regularly prioritize that list. The backlog as a whole is the input queue in the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently there are 397 issues on our backlog. We can&amp;rsquo;t possibly be meaningfully prioritizing all of these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a Kanban system, this is seen as waste. Why spend all this time prioritizing something when only the top five things at any one time are important? Is there a way to communicate to users that we just won&amp;rsquo;t get around to certain things?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At &lt;a href="http://www.corbisimages.com/">Corbis&lt;/a>, Anderson tried something different: he figured out how many items that were needed in the input queue to keep the system going. In other words, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be caught not knowing what to do next, so what number of items in the input queue would keep that from ever happening? Usually the number is less than five.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every week the team meets with the stakeholders and asks the simple question, &amp;ldquo;What are the most important X things to do next?&amp;rdquo; These items can be pulled off of the backlog or they could even be new. The stakeholders can discuss what the most important changes are and why. The important items are determined and then the changes flow through the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that this discussion is happening regularly, the territorial fighting should decrease. It&amp;rsquo;s up to those in the meeting to come to an agreement on what is next. If your thing isn&amp;rsquo;t done this week, then perhaps it will be done next week. Nothing is set in stone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few months of this, it should become apparent that some items on the backlog have very little chance of getting done. Therefore, if a backlog item is more than six months old, we should close it. We can always reopen it if is a priority, but it keeps open communication with those requesting changes about whether to expect the change anytime soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday in a project meeting one of our senior developers recommended that we focus more on ensuring buy-in from teams that we are serving for what we are doing. At the time I was focused on how to define appropriate metrics and so didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to implement her point. But now I see that if I follow this pattern of input queue management, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to bring together stakeholder&amp;rsquo;s desire to have something &lt;em>right now&lt;/em> and their ability to ensure that no other teams are blocking us from creating that outcome. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to see how this suggestion will work for us.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is Continuous Delivery Needed in Our Organization?</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/is-continuous-delivery-needed-in-our-organization/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 08:00:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/is-continuous-delivery-needed-in-our-organization/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-is-continuous-delivery-needed-in-our-organization.jpg" alt="Continuous Delivery" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Continuous Delivery sounds wonderful when &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/jez-humble-lean-enterprise">you&amp;rsquo;re at a conference&lt;/a>. You hear about companies like &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-continuous-delivery">Netflix&lt;/a> that deploy to production many times per day. When &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">learning Chef&lt;/a>, people often ask me if we really need something that will enable us to deploy that often. Some of them are on projects that take many months to deliver, and the customer would have it no other way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I answer this problem by splitting it up into two questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How quickly does a customer want a Severity 1 defect fixed in production?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d say the answer to this is usually, regardless of the tooling used, within a few hours. If there is a critical defect affecting operations, no one is talking about how we&amp;rsquo;ll have that delivered in a few months. People are on phones, developers are doing what it takes to get done, and something happens. So I&amp;rsquo;d say in this situation it&amp;rsquo;s a great investment to automate your delivery so the emergency situation is as tested as the non emergency situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How quickly does a customer want a feature in production?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a trickier question. We can separate the answer into what the customer &lt;em>wants&lt;/em> and what the customer &lt;em>expects&lt;/em>. The customer &lt;em>wants&lt;/em> to have the feature in production right now. Otherwise they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have told you about it. I have never heard a user make a request for change in software and say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just letting you know, I&amp;rsquo;d rather have it six months from now.&amp;rdquo; Now is always better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, our customers have a business to run, so they&amp;rsquo;re not going to be foolish with updates. They want us to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/">fully test and properly deliver the software&lt;/a>. So I believe their answer to this question would be: &lt;strong>as quickly as you can safely get it to me.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a flexible arrangement based on the trust we create from automating our delivery and testing process. The better job we do, the more they trust us and the quicker they get their software. It will probably never be _today_that they get updates, but also if we&amp;rsquo;re taking this seriously it also shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So even for us, with real customers that are paying us to get it right, there is room for continuous delivery and Chef.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The One Metric that Matters</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-one-metric-that-matters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 08:00:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-one-metric-that-matters/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>OMTM is a single metric that we prioritize as the most important to drive decisions depending on the stage of our product lifecycle and our business model…We focus on One Metric that Matters to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Answer the most pressing question we have by linking it to the assumptions in the hypothesis we want to test&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create focus, conversation, and thought to identify problems and simulate improvement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide transparency and a shared understanding across the team and wider organization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support a culture of experimentation by basing it on rates or ratios, not averages or totals, relevant to our historical data set&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>When I started out my current project in 2008, my boss for a very short time was &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeff-hughes/3/720/3a3">Jeff Hughes&lt;/a>, who is a genius at innovating software. The project I was doing was related to software quality, so Jeff gave me a metric for the first year: make defect containment go up, as defined by the percentage of software defects found inside the company related to the software defects found by our customers. He gave me the one metric that matters, and with that direction I was able to take the project in the direction it needed to go. At first we thought that we were going to stick with testing just customer situations, but we ended up having a mixture of customer situations and vanilla, or regression, situations. Without that &amp;ldquo;one metric that matters&amp;rdquo;, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had the freedom to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fast forward to last year, I started a project to improve the installation experience for all of our products that get installed in restaurants. Everyone seemed to want this to be better so I didn&amp;rsquo;t stop and create the one metric that matters. I rushed ahead and started on the solution. My one metric that mattered internally was lowered cycle time from a release to working software. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to define where we were before I started, and how my changes had improved the situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This led to a lot of unnecessary drama. People would question &lt;em>why&lt;/em> we were taking a particular approach. People would question whether an improvement was warranted in the first place (even after agreeing that it was warranted before). It&amp;rsquo;s easy to point fingers and talk about how people don&amp;rsquo;t understand or care, but they do understand and they do care. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to create a metric that would measure what outcome I&amp;rsquo;m trying to create.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is not a lesson &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/">I will soon forget&lt;/a>. I hope that I will be able to fundamentally transform my approach to include measurement as one of the key aspects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Progression of Responsibility</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/progression-of-responsibility/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2015 08:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/progression-of-responsibility/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>While reading &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1zxdulv">Lean Enterprise&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, I&amp;rsquo;m coming up with &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/mission-command/">a lot of great ideas&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-lean-startup-cycle/">improvements for my organization&lt;/a>. Much of the book so far has been about how to properly execute portfolio management within an enterprise to make sure that (1) you maximize ROI, and (2) you don&amp;rsquo;t manage your existing proven products with an investment horizon of this year or this quarter the same way that you would manage innovation products that have a longer investment horizon. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something occurred to me though. In order to gain entry into the higher level strategic decisions, one must first master the lower level ones. Here&amp;rsquo;s a progression I can see, that I wish I knew about ten years ago:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Personal Effectiveness:&lt;/strong> do you take on work in an efficient, organized way? Do you have a system for &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/getting-things-done-action-plan/" title="Getting Things Done Action Plan">getting things done&lt;/a>, a system for communicating with others, for follow-up, for &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/" title="Failure the Catalyst">what to do when things get difficult&lt;/a>? Do you know &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/two-questions-about-commitments/" title="Two Questions You Should Ask About Your Commitments">when you&amp;rsquo;re overcommitting&lt;/a>?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Planning Effectiveness:&lt;/strong> do you understand why we are doing what we are doing on this project? Do you measure things in terms of how they will profit your company or on some other, less meaningful way? Do you have a way to create value for your stakeholders quickly by strategically prioritizing certain things over others? Do you know what the short-term and long-term risks to the product and what can be done about them?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Management Effectiveness:&lt;/strong> do you know &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/" title="Measure for Reality">how to measure success&lt;/a>? Have you linked the measurement to profitability of the company? Are you able to iteratively create improvements to measurements in a fluid, changing situation? Are people motivated by your leadership and understand the parameters that you&amp;rsquo;ve set out that measures your team&amp;rsquo;s success?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Executive Effectiveness:&lt;/strong> are you able to create profitability for the various products in your portfolio in a way that respects their lifecycle? Are your established, older products increasing in quality and customer satisfaction? Have your newer innovative products succeeded in creating new markets, as measured by appropriate metrics? Has your team leadership received the appropriate amount of direction (not too detailed to constrain innovation and not too broad to create chaos)? Have you had innovation experiments that have failed in the past three months, that had minimal investment yet provided a valuable lesson for the leadership team?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Right now I&amp;rsquo;m at #3. It&amp;rsquo;s fun reading about #4 in the book, but I do realize the trap of trying to live in a place that is beyond your current capability:** If you live in a later stage than you&amp;rsquo;re at right now, you end up ignoring the key elements that are needed to progress to the next stage.** So I can start thinking a lot about portfolio management or how we would manage innovative products differently than our established products. But if I get too caught up in that, I avoid the reality for me right now: I need to find a measurement of success that leads to profitability of my company for every project that I&amp;rsquo;m doing, be able to communicate that to others, and manage its improvement with a team. That will be my focus over the next year or so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If someone comes to me about how we need to do a better job planning yet don&amp;rsquo;t have an established workflow for how they manage their own work, I quickly get them focused on that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If someone wants to be a manager of a group but can&amp;rsquo;t see what that group is doing strategically and the trade-offs that exist in the group, I get them focused on that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have to master your current responsibilities before you can progress to others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Phoenix Project Book Review</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-phoenix-project-book-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2015 08:00:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-phoenix-project-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;ve looked into devops more and more over the past few months, the book &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1AinIdB">The Phoenix Project&lt;/a> has come up over and over. I finally bought it when Matt Stratton at chef basically insisted on it in &lt;a href="http://www.mattstratton.com/tech/devops">his very awesome reading list&lt;/a> to ramp yourself up on devops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been into fiction very much, but over the summer I read &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1zx9aT7">A Man in Full&lt;/a> as a means of integrating stoicism into my own philosophy. That book lit up my imagination and helped me absorb the stoic themes in a way that would be difficult had I just read an outline of stoicism. I was awakened to the reality of how fiction can transform your mind deeply by awakening all aspects of the mind during learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I was very excited to read the book. And the book did not disappoint in changing my outlook on my own career and what is possible for those around me. It taught me a few basic lessons that I believe will transform my behavior in the future:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Have a respect for the system.&lt;/strong> Up until I read this book I treated a inefficient system like it was garbage. Let&amp;rsquo;s get rid of the inefficiency! This is dumb! What I realized by reading the book is that in order for you to effectively and profitably change a system, you must have a respect and understanding of why it is the way it is. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know why it is this way, you can realize that it is an inefficient system, but you will not effectively change it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/">Measure, Measure, Measure&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong> The main character in the book has a great respect for measurement. People say you can&amp;rsquo;t manage what you don&amp;rsquo;t measure. I think that can be taken too far, but there is a reality in it: if I can&amp;rsquo;t measure the reality of the system, it will be very difficult for me to (1) convince people that a more efficient change is needed, and (2) know that the changes I am making are having their desired effect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Take a Breath and Count to 2.&lt;/strong> One of the nice things about the book that taught me a lesson is when the main character interacts with various antagonists, who are obviously being reckless, dumb, and incendiary, the main character will take a breath and count to 2. Then respond. And when he responds, it&amp;rsquo;s with facts and an attitude of doing what&amp;rsquo;s best for everyone. I desperately want to exhibit this kind of tact and patience. I get so passionate about my ideas that I can forget to have patience, be calm, and move the ball forward.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Find the Bottleneck Constraint.&lt;/strong> In the book there is a legendary character named Brent. Brent can do everything. He can fix problems in seconds that everyone has spent days trying to understand. He knows why this server is the way it is, and the answer lies in activities from 2002. Brent has everyone asking him for everything and the business is at it&amp;rsquo;s knees due to Brent&amp;rsquo;s inability to clone himself into fifty other people. In the book, the main focus was on getting Brent isolated and his work properly documented, prioritized, and managed. Brent remained a hugely valuable member of the team, but they couldn&amp;rsquo;t grow until his workload was under control. And once Brent had his priorities under control, he was able to do some special things for the company.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed the Phoenix Project and recommend it to anyone wanting to lead change in their organization using lean principles. It reaches the reader in a way that a nonfiction book can&amp;rsquo;t: you can feel the tension. You drop the F-bombs right there with the reader. You feel the desperation as the core concepts come to life. And therefore when you face similar situations, you have a whole new world of awesome manufacturing theory available to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book was one of the best software-related books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. If you want to be a leader, please get a copy and read it. Then invite me to lunch and let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it; maybe we can change the world together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Son's Choice Between Negativity and Taking Action</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/my-sons-choice-between-negativity-and-taking-action/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2015 08:00:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/my-sons-choice-between-negativity-and-taking-action/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>My son has felt negative about everything lately which has created for him a vicious cycle of disdain and despair. &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/embrace-difficulty/" title="Embrace Difficulty">He is a lot like me&lt;/a>, so whenever we learn a lesson about him, it usually has something to do with &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/" title="Failure the Catalyst">how I&amp;rsquo;m wired as well&lt;/a>. He and I sat in bed a few nights ago and I walked him through this very basic method of how leaders have a choice to make:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I talked about how he and I are gifted with the ability to think deeply about things and thus we see things that other people don&amp;rsquo;t see.** We have the responsibility of being able to see problems that other people don&amp;rsquo;t see.** Something that bothers him is how his cub scout pack meetings spend too much time talking to the parents and that leaves him feeling like the meeting isn&amp;rsquo;t his. When I asked one of his good friends about cub scouts, his friend said, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m cursed as well about seeing problems everywhere. I talked to a police officer one time that told me that every room he goes into, even if it&amp;rsquo;s a church sanctuary, he automatically tries to ascertain who in that room is a potential threat. That man has a similar curse: he sees problems that other people don&amp;rsquo;t see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I then asked Samuel why he thought President Obama wanted to be President. &amp;ldquo;Because he wanted to be famous.&amp;rdquo; I told him how there are better ways of being famous. The truth is Mr. Obama became President Obama because he saw problems that others didn&amp;rsquo;t see and cared enough about them to get in public life. &lt;strong>A leader always starts with a perception of something wrong in the world.&lt;/strong> If nothing was wrong, there would be no leaders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it&amp;rsquo;s a given that a potential leader sees problems. It is our curse. The question now, is: what are we going to do about it? There are two choices:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A potential leader &lt;em>could&lt;/em> choose the path of negativity, disdain, and ultimately despair.&lt;/strong> This is the path of the critic, the internet troll, or the quitter. This is the path my son was on and one I&amp;rsquo;ve been on many times. I can see what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with the situation, and my response is to continue to criticize or believe that nothing will ever change and quit. It&amp;rsquo;s even easier to do this when &lt;em>I&amp;rsquo;m the only one who sees the problems!&lt;/em> Well of course you&amp;rsquo;re the only one who sees the problems; perhaps that&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re the one who is supposed to do something about it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Or a potential leader &lt;em>could&lt;/em> choose the path of taking action, improvement, patience, and love.&lt;/strong> In other words &lt;strong>a potential leader could choose the path of leadership.&lt;/strong> This is the path I encouraged Samuel to take. The question isn&amp;rsquo;t what problems do you see with cub scout pack meetings; the question is what are you going to do about those problems? When you see a problem with a group of people, the loving thing you can do is, within your power, help solve that problem with them! It&amp;rsquo;s not to despair and quit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes problems are so deep and impenetrable that there is nothing you can do about them. At that point the best thing to do &lt;em>is&lt;/em> quit. However, most times the problems are there and as a leader we can work to make them better. That&amp;rsquo;s the path of leadership, the path of people who are cursed with the ability to recognize problems that others don&amp;rsquo;t see and choose to take action to solve those problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Programming Ruby (Pickaxe) Book Review</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/programming-ruby-pickaxe-book-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2015 08:00:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/programming-ruby-pickaxe-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When I started &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">learning Chef&lt;/a> in earnest I realized quickly that my need to know what was happening was leading me to need to dive into a book on Ruby and figure out what all the magic I was seeing in Chef was really about. Chef has an amazing way of being usable for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know much Ruby, but I&amp;rsquo;m the curious type that just needs to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started out with &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/13QZz1v">The Ruby Programming Language&lt;/a> but found it to be too much of a reference work that basically stated facts about the language instead of walking the reader through the learning process. I was delighted to find &lt;a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby&lt;/a> to be exactly that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was able to get through the book in a few days. It starts you out with objects, which for Ruby is the right place to start out. As I&amp;rsquo;m teaching my son how to program, the concept of objects is very easy for him to pick up. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to start with primitives, then control flow, then objects for people to learn. Learning is less logically structured than that. People don&amp;rsquo;t think like computers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each chapter in the book is about fifteen to twenty minutes of time investment and walks you through an example that you can easily code on your own. I find that when learning these things, I can&amp;rsquo;t just read it and know it. I need to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> something as well. This book did a great job at keeping me engaged with my ruby interpreter as well as with my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In November I set a goal to be working with Ruby every day by February. This book did a great job at making the goal possible. It demystified how Chef was doing its magic, but it has done so much more. It has opened me up to a whole new world of possibilities by quickly being able to script a solution to a problem without having to go through all the hoops of a statically typed programming language. While I still love C# and will use it for certain problems, Ruby is not a part of my life, thanks partly to this excellent book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Lean Startup Cycle</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-lean-startup-cycle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2015 08:00:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-lean-startup-cycle/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>When &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hauser">Herman Hauser&lt;/a> created a team to create the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM processor&lt;/a>, now the processor that runs most of the mobile devices you know and love, &lt;a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/358750/whatever-happened-to-hermann-hauser">he remarked&lt;/a>*:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When we decided to do a microprocessor, in hindsight, I think I made two great decisions. I trusted the team and gave them two things that Intel and Motorola had never given their people: the first was no money and the second was no people. They had to keep it simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>When you start a project the normal course of action is to try to get as many people as possible so you will be able to have enough resources to accomplish the goal. In &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1HdjuUt">Lean Enterprise&lt;/a>, the authors advocate another way, what they call &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">the Lean Startup Cycle&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Working out what we need to &lt;em>learn&lt;/em> by creating a value hypothesis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide what to &lt;em>measure&lt;/em> in order to test that hypothesis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design an experiment, called the &lt;em>minimum viable product&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Build&lt;/em> the minimum viable product to gather the necessary data from real customers to determine if we have a good product/market fit.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The authors continue:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The trick is to invest a minimum of work to go through this cycle. Since we are operating in conditions of extreme uncertainty, we expect that our value hypothesis will be incorrect. At this point we &lt;em>pivot&lt;/em>, coming up with a new value hypothesis based on what we have learned, and go through this process again.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I love this idea. Instead of wasting years of time and money on an idea, let&amp;rsquo;s realize that we don&amp;rsquo;t know everything and use the scientific method to get us to the right idea. Let&amp;rsquo;s not be afraid of failure; you can&amp;rsquo;t have innovation without failure. &lt;strong>The key to innovation isn&amp;rsquo;t avoiding failure; the key is reacting to failure earlier than the competition.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method also calls into question the annual budget cycle. If all you have is once chance a year to respond to reality, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up clamoring for more people and avoid the simple, early, scientific method laid out above. A better way is to start small, provide some runway to solve a problem, and scale only when the solution shows its value in the real world.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I got this quote from Lean Enterprise as well, but cite the original source as they did.&lt;/li>

&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-mission-command.jpg" alt="Mission Command" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In the past whenever I found myself micromanaged, I complained that I&amp;rsquo;m not in the military, and I should have freedom to operate in my best judgement to solve the problem. I viewed the military as a command and control environment where orders were specifically given and followed to the T. I then reasoned that this is not how successful organizations operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The excellent book &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1zGXBeP">Lean Enterprise&lt;/a>&lt;/em> has debunked this myth with a concept of Mission Command that I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you. From the book*:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In reality, command and control has not been fashionable in military circles since 1806 when the Prussian Army, a classic plan-driven organization, was decisively defeated by Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s decentralized, highly motivated forces.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Sounds a lot like a startup vs. a large company. Except this is two hundred years ago. The authors continue:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Napoleon used a style of war known as &lt;em>maneuver warfare&lt;/em> to defeat, larger, better-trained armies. In maneuver warfare, the goal is to minimize the need for actual fighting by disrupting your enemy&amp;rsquo;s ability to act cohesively through the use of shock and surprise. A key element in maneuver warfare is beinig able to learn, make decisions, and act faster than your enemy.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Once the Prussians were defeated, they studied what went wrong and how they needed to innovate their military strategy in order to regain dominance. Their thought leadership came up with the concept of &lt;em>Auftragstaktick&lt;/em>, or Mission Command:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In 1869, Helmuth von Moltke issued a directive titled &amp;ldquo;Guidance for Large Unit Commanders&amp;rdquo; which sets out how to lead a large organization under conditions of uncertainty. In this ducment, von Moltke notes that &amp;ldquo;in war, circumstances change very rapidly, and this is rare indeed for directions which cover a long period of time in a lot of detail to be fully carried out.&amp;rdquo; He thus recommends &lt;strong>&amp;lsquo;not commanding more than is strictly necessary, nor planning beyond the circumstances you can foresee.'&lt;/strong> Instead he has this advice: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>the higher the level of command, the shorter and more general the orders should be. The next level down should add whatever further specification it feels &lt;em>to be necessary&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> and the details of the execution are left to verbal instructions or perhaps a word of command.** This ensures that everyone retains the freedom of movement and decision within the bounds of their authority &amp;ldquo;**the rule to follow is that an order should contain all, but also only, what subordinates cannot determine for themselves to achieve a particular purpose.**&amp;rdquo; [emphasis mine]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So with lives on the line leaders implemented a sophisticated framework for implementing strategy while preserving freedom. This happened 150 years ago. It&amp;rsquo;s still difficult to implement today, though. We either overdo it with too much control because &amp;ldquo;the leaders know best, that&amp;rsquo;s why they&amp;rsquo;re leaders.&amp;rdquo; Or we give everyone autonomy and everyone ends up going in different directions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These kinds of ideas are what I love about the &lt;em>Lean Enterprise&lt;/em> book in particular and the lean movement in general. Software seems so new to everyone, that you can get caught up in solving problems in new ways and giving crazy names to them, like scrum, agile, TDD, etc. But the lean movement says, &amp;ldquo;Hey, we&amp;rsquo;ve had a few hundred years of solving problems with technology and enlightened thinking. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably find a lot of answers from those who have gone before you.&amp;rdquo; This concept of Mission Control is a great example of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the book also credits The &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1Hdelfn">Art of Action&lt;/a> for developing these ideas. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet read this book but it&amp;rsquo;s on my short list.&lt;/li>

&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-customizing-chef-book-review.jpg" alt="Customizing Chef" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When I was stuck trying to understand simple concepts about Chef, I bought two books: &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1wHMEZb">Learning Chef&lt;/a> (read the review) and &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1Ajtt8G">Customizing Chef&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="http://jonliv.es/">Jon Cowie&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning Chef gave me the basic concepts, but Customizing Chef gave me the deep understanding I needed to evaluate the tool for my large, complicated organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the closed-source Microsoft world, you figure out what the thing can do and just accept it. The book opened my eyes that Chef allows me to use a skill (reading code) that I&amp;rsquo;ve built up for over ten years. This leads to a much deeper understanding of how it works than just &amp;ldquo;trust us this feature does X&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s not the best thing about the book though. The thing I appreciated the most was the ability to learn from the author who implemented a world class deployment solution for &lt;a href="https://codeascraft.com/">Etsy&lt;/a> using chef. The examples he provided were real world. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a textbook exposition on chef. You could tell that this was the real deal. Learning from him in this way reinforced the idea that chef was something I could implement in my complicated organization and that with every problem that arises I have options because of chef&amp;rsquo;s extensibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author did a wonderful job at explaining that extensibility with examples at every level. I learned how to customize chef&amp;rsquo;s notification customizations, cookbooks, and even knife itself. Every explanation of a customization didn&amp;rsquo;t merely explain it; it started with the code and took the reader through a series of examples to build up understanding of the customization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Customizing Chef isn&amp;rsquo;t for someone who is just starting chef. For that I would recommend the tutorials or the book Learning Chef. For someone who is tasked with implementing it in a complicated organization or someone who has been using it for months and has come across some scaling challenges, this book is a life-saver.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coding for Kids</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/coding-for-kids/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 08:00:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/coding-for-kids/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>As a part of the &lt;a href="http://hourofcode.com/us">hour of code&lt;/a> initiative, I was pleased to present my perspective on computer programming to first and third graders at &lt;a href="http://www.gcisd-k12.org/Domain/1675">Grapevine Elementary School&lt;/a> in December. Through the presentation I was able to inspire the students to see programming in their future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been frustrated over the years with how little people know about programming. When I ask an eight year old what they want to do when they grow up, you get a lot of firemen, police officers, teachers, and professional athletes. When children of today grow up they will more likely work closely with computers, regardless of their profession. No one will be exempt. So it&amp;rsquo;s important for them to view programming as a tool, like math, reading, or writing, that is to be used to create value for others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I talked about the people who made this toy, the producers, and the people who bought it, the consumers. When they grow up and produce, they&amp;rsquo;ll produce solutions that use computers in awesome ways. We call that programming. They&amp;rsquo;ll call it normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ended the presentation with some myths related to programming:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Myth&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Reality&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>It&amp;rsquo;s only for video games&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Programming is for solving problems. Problems are everywhere, not just in video games&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>It&amp;rsquo;s only for adults&lt;/td>
&lt;td>My son learning &lt;a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby&lt;/a> through &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy&lt;/a> and using &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>It&amp;rsquo;s too complicated&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Actually trying to solve a complicated problem &lt;em>without&lt;/em> the help of a computer is complicated. Illiterate people think that reading is complicated. This is just another form of literacy.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Computers will take over the world and we won&amp;rsquo;t need humans anymore&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Computers do one thing well: do what they&amp;rsquo;re told. You can&amp;rsquo;t reduce love, empathy, and character to a set of instructions. Being able to work with other people is essential to one&amp;rsquo;s development and ultimate economic value to the world.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>My son and I are working through his math homework using Ruby right now. If that goes well I might post a few YouTube videos explaining it. I think there is a large, untapped group of people who would really be interested in finding programming literacy from a young age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to think Mrs. Cox&amp;rsquo;s fourth grade class for the encouraging thank-you notes on the presentation. You guys don&amp;rsquo;t know how much those meant to me. I also want to thank &lt;a href="http://www.gcisd-k12.org/Domain/2938">Nancy Hale&lt;/a> for setting it up and encouraging kids to learn coding.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning Chef Book Review</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 08:00:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-learning-chef-book-review.jpg" alt="Learning Chef Book Review" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A couple of months ago I found myself drowning in the learning curve that was &lt;a href="http://chef.io">chef&lt;/a>. I had great support from them, but I&amp;rsquo;m the type of person who needs to know a technology in order to appropriately evaluate it. I could tell that chef was a nice technology, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went through &lt;a href="https://learn.chef.io/">the tutorials&lt;/a> but they weren&amp;rsquo;t adequate for me to understand the solution. Then I found the book &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1Ajqayd">Learning Chef&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning Chef is an excellent first step in understanding the chef universe in order to get started on the right foot with the tool. I absolutely loved the tutorial, incremental approach that &lt;a href="http://misheska.com/">the&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://sethvargo.com/">authors&lt;/a> take to go from running a recipe on your own machine to running tests on locally available virtual machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which leads me to my other pleasant surprise of this book: it lays out the techniques you can use with chef in order to test what you&amp;rsquo;re doing so you know that it works. That is what separates chef from many other solutions I&amp;rsquo;ve seen: &lt;a href="http://kitchen.ci/">they bake testing into the process itself&lt;/a>. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to treat infrastructure as code then you &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to test it as a part of your deployment pipeline. Fortunately this introductory book doesn&amp;rsquo;t skimp on this core aspect of chef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third great thing about this book is that it is very approachable to those of us who have built their careers programming in the Windows environment. Every command has a hint at what you would do on a windows box. This really increased my comfort level with learning chef by allowing me to learn it in &lt;em>my own&lt;/em> development environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book is not for people who want a quick, few hour understanding of chef to get up and running. For example if I bring a new team on board with Chef, I probably won&amp;rsquo;t hand them this book; I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a couple of day class with them to teach them the basics. If they&amp;rsquo;re the type of person (like me) who wants to dig deeper though and learns by doing, this book is a fabulous step in becoming proficient at using chef.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solving SSL Validation failure with knife</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/solving-ssl-validation-failure-with-knife/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 08:00:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/solving-ssl-validation-failure-with-knife/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-solving-ssl-validation-failure-with-knife.jpg" alt="SSL Validation" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>After I moved to a hosted version of the &lt;a href="http://chef.io">chef&lt;/a> server, I started getting this problem with knife:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>knife download environments
ERROR: SSL Validation failure connecting to host: chef.yourdomain.com - SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server
certificate B: certificate verify failed
ERROR: OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify
failed
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>There are a couple of ways to fix this. The short-term way is to ignore SSL on your knife.rb file with this setting:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">ssl_verify_mode &lt;span style="color:#990073">:verify_none&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The better and more long-term solution is to add this line to the knife.rb file:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">trusted_certs_dir        &lt;span style="color:#d14">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">#{&lt;/span>current_dir&lt;span style="color:#d14">}&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#d14">/trusted_certs&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And then run:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">knife ssl fetch
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I then had to ignore the trusted_certs file in my git repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.mattstratton.com/">Matt Stratton&lt;/a> and his colleagues at &lt;a href="http://chef.io">chef&lt;/a> for helping me find the solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Look Around</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/a-look-around/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 11:39:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/a-look-around/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been about six months since &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">I started this blog&lt;/a> and I thought it&amp;rsquo;s time for a retrospective. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoye talking about issues and ideas that have really helped me find new insight and motivation for where I&amp;rsquo;d like to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed, I have had a bit of a content categorization problem that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the answer to. Let me explain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The motivation of starting my blog was pretty clear to me from the beginning:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/">Michael Hyatt&lt;/a> convinced me in &lt;a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/093-10-reasons-every-leader-needs-a-blog-podcast.html">a podcast&lt;/a> that by not having a platform for my ideas I was not going to be an effective influencer. The path to scaling influence is through creating a platform. The easiest way to begin building a platform is through a blog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I wanted to find a way to find like-minded people who could influence me, and who I could influence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I wanted to solidify a lot of what I was learning by writing about it and explaining it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I started out early by writing about a lot of professional topics, then some financial management topics. I saw very quickly that it would not be easy to build a professional oriented platform; the interest wasn&amp;rsquo;t there. The interest appeared to be there for the more personal oriented topics, so I went in that direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve written more and more about the ideas and experiences that I have found useful to accomplish my goals, and my readership has gone down and down. For example in July the readership numbers spiked at 50 or so sessions per day. At the moment the spike is more like 20 per day when I publish something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2014-12-08-a-look-around/site-metrics.png" alt="Site Metrics">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not bad that 20 or so people are reading the blog, but the problem is that a good portion of that are my extended family that I could easily (and more persuasively) share a personal conversation. So it&amp;rsquo;s clear right now that I need a change in strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I continue to work on deployment both for our hosted and our store products at my company. I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot of lessons, both through management and through learning new products. In fact I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time learning in the past eight weeks than I had in the past three years combined. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about where these ideas will take us, and want to share it with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re one of my readers who won&amp;rsquo;t care about that topic, I want to tell you two things. First, thanks for reading and for sticking with me. Second, I&amp;rsquo;d love to have lunch with you and talk about these topics further. I have a passion for living life well and think that in order to do that one must get off of the normal path set by us by our culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For everyone else, welcome to the new hedge-ops, which asks the question: &lt;strong>how can we operate most efficiently with management in technology&lt;/strong>. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to writing about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mornings</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/mornings/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2014 08:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/mornings/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>On the bad mornings, I begin by rolling over and checking my phone. I cycle through &lt;a href="http://www.espndallas.com">ESPN Dallas&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.wfaa.com">WFAA&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN&lt;/a>, and look at my &lt;a href="http://feedly.com/">feedly feed&lt;/a>, personal and work email. The work email in particular, since I work with Czechs who are well into their day, causes me to start thinking about work. My mind races to the world&amp;rsquo;s problems, the world&amp;rsquo;s drama, and problems I&amp;rsquo;ll need to solve in a couple of hours that began a half a world away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirty minutes later I get out of bed, make a breakfast, talk to my kids, and then I am late for work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the good mornings, &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/sanitize-your-smartphone-with-republic-wireless/">my phone is in another room&lt;/a>. I wake up, do a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shovelglove">14 minute workout&lt;/a>, read a little on the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/focus-with-the-amazon-kindle/">Kindle&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-economist-keeps-it-real/">Economist&lt;/a>, have some time for meditation/introspection. I think about my life as a whole and how I&amp;rsquo;m contributing to my goals today in realistic ways. I think about how I want to love and serve others in very real and tangible ways. I eat breakfast, and get to work on time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have as much time on the good mornings as the bad mornings. The key is being intentional and staying off the phone.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Ultimate Test of Tolerance</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-ultimate-test-of-tolerance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 08:00:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-ultimate-test-of-tolerance/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I am fortunate to be married &lt;a href="http://reclaimed.house">to someone&lt;/a> who shares many of &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/">my values and passions&lt;/a>. For the things we disagree with, though, I have to find a way &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/releasing-control/">to not control her&lt;/a> and to let her be her own person. This is the ultimate expression of tolerance: she is welcome in my personal space, influences my future, and is free to &amp;ldquo;ruin&amp;rdquo; it with her own dreams and values.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key to making it work is giving her freedom and working hard to connect so values and goals can be shared as much as possible. It won&amp;rsquo;t always work, but if it does, then it is the start of a lifestyle of this, which opens up so many wonderful relationships in all areas of life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We like to think of tolerance as something that happens with people who are drastically different than us. With people from other political parties, religions, or backgrounds. I&amp;rsquo;ve found over the years that tolerance really begins with those who are closest to me: &lt;strong>do I try to control them or do I let them freely be themselves?&lt;/strong> That&amp;rsquo;s ultimately the question that is asked of all of our relationships. The less we control, the better the relationships are.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Right Fit</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/right-fit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2014 08:00:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/right-fit/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">My wife&lt;/a> and I spent the early part of this week looking into a business opportunity that would help us meet some specific goals over the next few years. We were excited, talking late into the night about the various details of this business opportunity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then halfway into our trip we realized &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-masquerading-as-success/">it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, we could have made it work. We could have brought more into the deal and thus introduced more risk. We could have compromised our values or our goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was reminded me of &lt;a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2010/08/25/the-best-investment-advice-you-will-ever-get/">Mark Cuban&amp;rsquo;s advice&lt;/a>: get out of debt and save up 100K in cash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does he give this advice? Because if you have cash that you can invest, a right fit will come along and present itself. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go try to make things work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have to force anything. I can stay true to my values. And I should continue to live a simple and frugal lifestyle. If I do this, the right fit will come along.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Assumption of Agreement</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/assumption-of-agreement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2014 08:00:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/assumption-of-agreement/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>We were having a great time with our new friends from California on a gogi-berry farm in New Mexico. The family loves nature like us, and we had great conversations about &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/engineering-travel/">biking&lt;/a>, hiking, &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">living simply&lt;/a>, and cooking naturally. At one point the lady told us that they would love to have us back next summer and that they were pleasantly surprised to find out that there were liberals from Dallas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was eating dinner at my church on a Wednesday night with other members, and one member starts talking about how evil Wendy Davis is and how Obama has ruined everything. I sat there quietly as the whole table seemed to being railing on how dumb the Democrats were and how the world was going to end because of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s the common thread? It&amp;rsquo;s what I call the&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.chrisdikes.com/2013/05/30/the-ever-changing-idea-of-god/">Chris Dikes Assumption of Agreement Hypothesis&lt;/a>. From his post:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One common thread I&amp;rsquo;ve found is this:  people want, sometimes even insist, for you to agree with them and what they think about God/religion.  Divergence of opinion and differing ideas are seen as a threat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t get that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Well said, Chris. I don&amp;rsquo;t get it, either. I think this extends to politics and lifestyle, as well. We all assume that everyone in our group will think of us as being intelligent and on the right path. Anyone who thinks we&amp;rsquo;re not on the right path is obviously a threat to that and must be silenced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we want to grow, influence others, and sharpen our thinking we need to grow past this. &lt;strong>Disagreement isn&amp;rsquo;t a threat&lt;/strong>. &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/">Everyone doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to agree with us&lt;/a>. In fact, if we&amp;rsquo;re truly honest with ourselves, &lt;strong>&lt;em>people who disagree with us are much more effective at changing our perspective when we let them.&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> We can never get there if we&amp;rsquo;re not open to the assumption that there are pleasant people with whom we have a lot in common that fundamentally disagree with some of our religious, political, or cultural views.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Litmus Test for Tolerance</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/a-litmus-test-for-tolerance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2014 08:00:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/a-litmus-test-for-tolerance/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>About ten years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">my wife&lt;/a> and I were deeply involved in a church that claimed to be evangelistic and desperately wanted to lead people to God. We devoted ourselves to The Cause and poured hours and hours of our labor into its programs. At one point (I kid you not), I was doing the music on Sunday mornings, keeping track of our procedure for keeping and maintaining new members, leading youth group on Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights, attending another small group Bible study, and taking a graduate level Seminary class. All of this while having a full time job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem, looking back on it: I wasn&amp;rsquo;t growing. Why not? I believe a simple litmus test could have exposed it for me very quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s a test I have run through my life quite extensively since this experience:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In the past three months, how many people have been in my home that can and will openly but respectfully disagree with my political, religious, or cultural views?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my overcommitted church days, that was no one outside of my extended family. I was a part of a giant echo chamber. I suppose this is true of a lot of people at church. You hear over and over again in those environments that the key is to be outwardly focused, but then when you actually survey those within the organization itself, &lt;strong>&lt;em>many have absolutely no personal contact with those outside of their political, cultural, and religious beliefs.&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So do you think of yourself as someone who is growing and tolerant of others? Test out that thought by inviting someone over who doesn&amp;rsquo;t share your political beliefs, or was born outside of the United States. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, doing so will open up a whole new realm of fulfillment and growth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Proper Understanding of the Opposition</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/a-proper-understanding-of-the-opposition/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 08:00:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/a-proper-understanding-of-the-opposition/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a fun exercise: first read the first five headlines on &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/">DailyKOS&lt;/a>. Next read the first five headlines on &lt;a href="http://www.lucianne.com/">Lucianne&lt;/a>. See any patterns?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>On DailyKOS&lt;/strong> you get the feeling that Republicans are heartless idiots with half a brain, and that our world&amp;rsquo;s problems would be solved if they would just get out of the way of progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>On Lucianne,&lt;/strong> you get the feeling that Democrats are heartless idiots with half a brain and that our world&amp;rsquo;s problems would be solved if they would just get out of the way of progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re the typical American, you probably relate to one site and not to another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve only recently recognized how destructive this is to my life, my thinking, and my relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I want to pursue &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">a life of meaning and purpose&lt;/a>, I need to be constantly open to the reality that &lt;strong>&lt;em>I don&amp;rsquo;t have all the answers&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> and pursue growth in all areas. If I&amp;rsquo;m doing this right this means that I will learn from people with drastically different perspectives than me. If I was only a part of the American Political echo chamber on either side, I would in effect cut myself off of half of the country&amp;rsquo;s ideas and thoughts. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a recipe for growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I want to deepen my ability to think about tough, difficult issues the world faces, I need to be constantly open to the reality that &lt;em>&lt;strong>tough issues cannot be reduced to simple soundbite answers those from the media on both sides provide.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> If I go through life just listening to one side and thinking that if the other side would just grow half a brain we&amp;rsquo;d all move past these elementary problems, I end up being mentally lazy. And I don&amp;rsquo;t grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I want to have people in my life that I can influence, I need to constantly be open to the reality that &lt;em>&lt;strong>I can never influence people who totally agree with me.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> That&amp;rsquo;s an impossibility built on a perfectionistic lie that the only think keeping people from succeeding is their idiotic ideas that you have obviously moved passed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you&amp;rsquo;re a Republican and meet a Democrat and think to yourself, &amp;ldquo;What a tool of the liberal media elite&amp;rdquo;, you&amp;rsquo;re killing the relationship right then and there. You may still spend time with this person and some of it may be enjoyable. But if you think that someone in terms of a tool and not a thinking breathing person, they will notice this and they will not listen to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growth in meaning, thinking, and relationships begin with accepting that you don&amp;rsquo;t know everything and thus could be wrong. It then follows that you accept all types of people in your life to sharpen and grow your perspective. Following this path is much more rewarding than stewing for years and years about Obama, or Bush, or the Iraq war, or whatever else you might get upset about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A European Education</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/a-european-education/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 22:14:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/a-european-education/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>Yesterday I was at lunch with a Czech friend of mine talking about education. His daughter just started the first grade and this week they had their initial teacher conferences. The teacher informed him and his wife that the daughter had a hard time focusing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Of course she can&amp;rsquo;t focus; they have her there from 8AM to 3PM. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t focus at that age either!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It never occurred to me that there was anything out of place about the duration of the American elementary public school.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I asked him how long school was in the Czech Republic. He said that first graders would be out by 11:30 AM. Wow, what a way to solve the problem of so many kids who are diagnosed with ADHD but may just need to run around and climb a few trees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our exchange student last year brought some perspective as well. She explained that when kids in Czech are in the fourth grade, they separate the &amp;ldquo;academic&amp;rdquo; ones from the non-academic ones. The academic ones are prepared for the university. The non-academic ones are prepared for a vocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead of forcing a bunch of people into a mountain of student loan debt that puts them in a career or job that they don&amp;rsquo;t perform in, we could train them to &lt;em>not&lt;/em> go to college, save a ton of money, get back years of earning instead of going to school, and live much more confident and productive lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of labelling kids as being bad because they can&amp;rsquo;t (unnaturally) sit in a room for seven hours with a few breaks in between, we could limit the amount of time young students spend in school.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I absolutely love having friends with different perspectives and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/" title="Life is Art">life experiences&lt;/a>. The American system is not the only good system; it&amp;rsquo;s not even the best in most things. Without my European friends, I would never see that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Two Questions You Should Ask About Your Commitments</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/two-questions-about-commitments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2014 08:00:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/two-questions-about-commitments/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-two-questions-about-commitments.jpg" alt="Commitments" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Lately we have been too busy, and we have had to figure out &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/" title="Achievable Contentment">what is working for us&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/" title="Failure the Catalyst">what isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/a>. Usually when we get this way, our entire lives are filtered through two questions. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share them with you to think about what the answers are in your life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, make a list of the things in your life that you&amp;rsquo;re committed to. I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK, now for each of those things ask, &lt;strong>&lt;em>How would I feel if this wasn&amp;rsquo;t in my life? Relieved&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>? Then perhaps it should be a candidate for either changing or removing it from your life. How you feel when imagining something is gone is the best way to know if you really want to do something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now for the second question: &lt;strong>What would be the reaction of others if you &lt;em>did&lt;/em> say no?&lt;/strong> This is a tricky one, because it shows the long-term health of your relationships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can tell my wife, &amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that. Let&amp;rsquo;s think of an alternative.&amp;rdquo; She would respond with love, acceptance, and we would work something out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell my church from college that. If you had asked me at the time to imagine it being gone, I would have sworn up and down to you that I loved it, etc. But then if you would have asked me if I was &lt;em>free&lt;/em> to reject it, if I was being honest I would have to say no.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So &lt;strong>rid yourself of everything you are relieved to get rid of. Only keep that which you can freely and openly reject.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Focus with the Amazon Kindle</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/focus-with-the-amazon-kindle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2014 08:00:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/focus-with-the-amazon-kindle/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/" title="Life is Art">focusing on what matters&lt;/a> lately by &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">making good choices&lt;/a> with how and what you consume. Some things are just a complete waste of time like the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/rubbernecking-with-the-locals/">local news&lt;/a>. Other things have a good alternative, like &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-economist-keeps-it-real/">reading the Economist&lt;/a> instead of going to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/">news sites&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I wrote last time, though, in this mobile world that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. You have to make sure your smartphone is serving you and not enslaving you. And beyond that I&amp;rsquo;m convinced &lt;strong>to lead a life of growth and meaning you need to read.&lt;/strong> Probably more than you are right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how do we do that? The solutions that come to mind immediately are: on our smartphone, a paper book, or a tablet. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about a better way to read books: through the Amazon Kindle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few years back &lt;a href="http://www.chrisdikes.com/">my friend Chris&lt;/a> asked me what I thought about the Kindle, and my opinion to him as of July 16, 2010 was: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>It seems like having a book would be better.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; Well, thankfully Chris didn&amp;rsquo;t listen to my awful advice and bought one, told me about it, changed my mind, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s so great about the Kindle:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Distractionless:&lt;/strong> yes, that&amp;rsquo;s a feature and not a bug. I like it that there aren&amp;rsquo;t pop ups telling me all about the emails I&amp;rsquo;m not reading or the cool Facebook posts that I need to be looking into. I&amp;rsquo;m here to read. The Kindle helps me read.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Battery Life:&lt;/strong> I don&amp;rsquo;t have to be preoccupied with powering the stupid thing while I&amp;rsquo;m using it. I can read. I have to charge it every once and a while. It&amp;rsquo;s not like the power sucking smartphone or tablet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Position Independent:&lt;/strong> this may seem small to some, but I like reading while I&amp;rsquo;m laying down. And I get comfortable holding a book in one hand. Then I read fast and get to the other side of the book. So I have to move to read the other section. It seems like a small thing, and admittedly a first-world problem, but I love how I can read the Kindle with one hand laying on the same side for as long as it is comfortable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sleep Friendly Lighting:&lt;/strong> I have the Kindle paperwhite that doesn&amp;rsquo;t blast light into my eyes and keep me up. I can do a little nighttime reading with a very small amount of light. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t distract my wife.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Borrower Capable:&lt;/strong> I have learned to take advantage of my library&amp;rsquo;s borrower privileges on the Kindle. This is easy once you figure it out. I do admit to buying more books than I would have before, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing as long as I read them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Keeps Your Place:&lt;/strong> I pick up the book and read exactly where I left off. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to think about it. I just go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Read More:&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;ve read much more than before. If I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a topic, I can get a book on that topic and read through it quickly while I have a passion and interest in the book.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Portable:&lt;/strong> I admit to not doing it very often, but if I want to, I can read on my smartphone or even my computer to continue my reading.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I highly recommend going for a Kindle. You need to read to meet your goals, and in my mind there is no better way to do so than with the Kindle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sanitize Your Smartphone with Republic Wireless</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/sanitize-your-smartphone-with-republic-wireless/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2014 08:00:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/sanitize-your-smartphone-with-republic-wireless/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>The invention of the iPhone will probably be one of the key technological events of my lifetime. It changed the game from quirky Blackberry kind-of-phones, to a new experience that delivered a whole set of new capabilities in people&amp;rsquo;s lives. It has changed &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/">the businesses I serve&lt;/a> and will continue to change our lives for years to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I finally got an iPhone it took over my life. This coincided with the birth of my children, so I spent a lot of time on the iPhone while they were at the park, or sleeping, or messing around at our house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Then I realized that I will never get those moments back.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I realized that the promise of convenience and greater efficiency does not line up with &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">my personal goals&lt;/a> because my personal goals are to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/">live a life of meaning, love, and connection&lt;/a>, especially with my family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To put it more simply, &lt;strong>I was on my phone and ignoring my family.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What to do about this? I considered going away from a smartphone. That didn&amp;rsquo;t seem possible because there were times where it really did serve me. I tried to make a few rules like, &amp;ldquo;Stop ignoring my children&amp;rdquo;, but those didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work when the siren song of Facebook and email came singing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of that, I was spending over a thousand dollars a year on this habit that wasn&amp;rsquo;t serving me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Then I learned about a better way: Republic Wireless.&lt;/strong> With Republic Wireless, I bought a phone for $300* and now spend $10 a month on my mobile phone. I get data through Wi-Fi, which, by the way, exists at home and at work. I don&amp;rsquo;t get data on the way home from work. If I&amp;rsquo;m traveling, I get the option to change to the $25 a month plan that has data. I can even change it back to the $10 plan when I get home and only pay for the $25 plan prorated for the amount of days I used it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means that I don&amp;rsquo;t instinctively go for the phone when I&amp;rsquo;m out and about. It&amp;rsquo;s a tool; it&amp;rsquo;s not my master. It also means if I need it to direct me somewhere I can type in directions before I leave when I&amp;rsquo;m on Wi-Fi, and the smartphone will get me there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel like I have the best of both worlds. Combine that with my $10/month landline, I now have no excuse to be on my phone…ever. &lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s an accessory. It&amp;rsquo;s not my whole life.&lt;/strong> Now I can live with the best elements of it and leave the rest alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in freeing your life from the insane addiction from the smartphone, you can get $10 off of Republic Wireless (as well as give me $10 off on my bill) by going &lt;a href="http://rwshar.es/6lhy">here&lt;/a>. Enjoy!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You can get them even cheaper for $99 for an off-contract phone. Do the math and you&amp;rsquo;ll save a bundle while being able to spend less time on your phone. It&amp;rsquo;s a win-win!&lt;/li>

&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-facing-the-ultimate-distraction-and-often-losing.jpg" alt="Distraction" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It was around 2008, and I heard about this new way to interact with people in your world. We were at a family gathering, and I started talking about this great application I had found called Facebook. My sister-in-law was delighted that we had finally caught up with her and that we were all going to join in this wonderful new thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those were the days when we were all so clueless about social media that Facebook had to cue us to post stuff, with &amp;ldquo;Michael is . . . &amp;quot; and then you wrote your thought into the text area. So the posts were things like &amp;ldquo;is enjoying my &lt;a href="http://www.nosdiet.com/">s-day&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; on August 23, 2008 and &amp;ldquo;is getting ready to go to India&amp;rdquo; on September 25, 2008 (almost exactly six years ago).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been great. I&amp;rsquo;ve stayed connected to people and shared in the lives of others in a way that I would not have before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a confession to make though:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a very conflicted relationship with Facebook. To understand, let&amp;rsquo;s filter the last few posts I&amp;rsquo;ve written on through the lens of what it promises and what it delivers:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Category&lt;/th>
&lt;th>What it Promises&lt;/th>
&lt;th>What it Delivers&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/">Traditional News&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Your world doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter as much as all of these important people doing important things. Know about them so you can influence them&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A visceral and frustrated passion for things over which you have no control&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/sports-news-soap-operas-for-people-who-make-fun-of-soap-operas/">Sports News&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The game will be much more fun if you know EVERYTHING there is to know about it. So know the gossip and facts behind everything you are watching so your hobby can become your life!&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Paying way too much attention to sports is a substitute for real growth and changes in your life.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/rubbernecking-with-the-locals/">Local News&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This is YOUR WORLD, these are YOUR NEIGHBORS, this stuff can happen to you. So you better pay attention before your lack of attention can cost you dearly.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None of this affects your life, it&amp;rsquo;s just used as a distraction.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Facebook&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This really is your world. We&amp;rsquo;re serious this time. This really does affect you. Why would it not? These are your friends! So pay attention so you can live a more informed life pertaining to your world around you&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This replaces smalltalk which in reality will hurt your relationships with others, not help&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Hopefully that illustrates it for you. The promise of Facebook is so alluring: this is a situation in which being informed can really pay off. After all, this is your life! The problem is there is not a very easy way to filter out the noise within Facebook to get to the reality. And the second problem is that even when people are informed about your life through Facebook, when you finally meet face to face &lt;em>there is nothing to talk about!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You read that correctly. &lt;strong>Facebook, rather than making you &lt;em>more social&lt;/em> actually makes you less social.&lt;/strong> You already know the things about people that you used to talk to them about to gain interest. So over time you talk to people in smalltalk less and less. Over time you are less and less social.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this is my conflicted relationship with Facebook. On the one hand I like being in tune with friends and family. On the other hand, that comes at the price of a lot of checking and time. I&amp;rsquo;ve considered over and over giving it up all together. But as my brother says, &lt;a href="http://weknowmemes.com/2011/11/quitting-facebook-is-the-adult-version-of-running-away-from-home/">leaving Facebook is the adult&amp;rsquo;s equivalent of running away from home&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wish I had some answers for you on this one. On paper this is something I should give up, but somehow I keep coming back to it over and over again. Maybe in a year I&amp;rsquo;ll have a good balance. But right now I don&amp;rsquo;t and I just wish the whole thing would go away. Maybe that means I&amp;rsquo;m ready for a break.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You Have Time</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/you-have-time/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2014 08:00:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/you-have-time/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break from &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/rubbernecking-with-the-locals/">my hatred of all things&lt;/a> news to take a step back and write about &lt;em>why&lt;/em> I&amp;rsquo;ve been so negative in these recent posts about the news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not against entertainment. I think it serves a valuable role in our lives. I like watching a football game or hearing about things that are none of my business. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I just no longer fool myself into thinking that it matters.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s just entertainment. This isn&amp;rsquo;t life or death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I read books so I can grow into a better person, that takes time. When I &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/engineering-travel/">ride my bike&lt;/a> to work every day instead of driving a car, that takes time. When &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/focus-with-the-amazon-kindle/">I read&lt;/a>, spend time with my family, volunteer, that all takes time. And our first reaction to changing things up in order &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/">to live out our values is&lt;/a>: I don&amp;rsquo;t have time. I disagree.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You have time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, I said that right. &lt;strong>You have tons of time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not having time means that you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to consume the news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not having time means that you never watch TV for anything ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not having time means that you don&amp;rsquo;t get a full night&amp;rsquo;s sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not having time means that you never do anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve feeding or sheltering your family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>You have time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My time waster is the news. I used to spend literally hours a day reading and thinking about it. Yours might be different. Whatever it is, see it for what it is, put things in perspective, and focus on what really matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question is not: When will I have enough time to do what matters?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question is: &lt;strong>When will I stop doing what doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter so I&amp;rsquo;ll have enough time to do what matters?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That mindset change will change your life.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rubbernecking with the Locals</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/rubbernecking-with-the-locals/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2014 08:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/rubbernecking-with-the-locals/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bumper to bumper traffic. Lights ahead. An ambulance speeds by in the shoulder lane.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We inch by for a few minutes, and finally make it to the accident. Then something inevitable happens:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OMG what happened!?!?! I need to brake and see what happened! Are they going to be OK? Do I know them? Is there&amp;hellip;BLOOD?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rubbernecking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is exactly what is happening in the local news. I&amp;rsquo;d like to give you a test to take right now:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Go to your &lt;a href="http://www.wfaa.com">local news site&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Count how many articles that fulfill this criteria:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You will remember them a month from now&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You didn&amp;rsquo;t hear about them from another source&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They will affect your life in some way&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I just did this as of this writing, on September 5. I counted zero articles. I think that you might come up with a similar amount.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s going on here?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We like knowing that no matter how bad things are for us, or how crappy our day is, there are at least a few people on the news that have it worse.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What value does this serve us? Logically speaking, absolutely none. This is a worthless activity. It isn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/sports-news-soap-operas-for-people-who-make-fun-of-soap-operas/">entertaining like sports&lt;/a>. It has no significance in the lifes and livelihood of all but a very small number of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;m trying to wean myself off of my local news addiction. I&amp;rsquo;m not replacing it with anything. I&amp;rsquo;m just stopping. I&amp;rsquo;ve had varying degrees of success over the past few months, because I love reading the local news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worthless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope to fully believe that one day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sports News: Soap Operas for People Who Make Fun of Soap Operas</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/sports-news-soap-operas-for-people-who-make-fun-of-soap-operas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 08:00:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/sports-news-soap-operas-for-people-who-make-fun-of-soap-operas/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>In the past I used to listen to &lt;em>The Ticket&lt;/em> every day on the way to and from work. I would follow the local teams through ups and downs. When the Dallas Cowboys won their only playoff game in the last almost twenty years, I was turning on The Ticket to hear their analysis. When the Mavericks won their World Championship a few years ago, I celebrated with my friends on the Ticket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I realized something:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sports News is even more worthless than &amp;ldquo;Real&amp;rdquo; News.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, you are hearing me correctly. I &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/">just finished&lt;/a> outlining everything wasteful and dumb about CNN and Fox News, but I&amp;rsquo;m saying sports news is even worse than that. The difference: at least in &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; news we are talking about people&amp;rsquo;s lives and well being. In sports we are talking about a game using the same medium and tone that we talk about people&amp;rsquo;s lives and well being.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of observations really hit this home for me:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sports news &lt;em>loves&lt;/em> the soap opera story.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s funny to think that way, too, since so many sports fans are uber-masculine and would never admit to enjoying soap operas as entertainment. A few examples (as you read these in the tone of an airhead woman in her early twenties talking about a soap opera):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>_OMG did you hear about** &lt;a href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/mlb/story/_/id/11471420/ron-washington-quits-manager-texas-rangers">Ron Washington&lt;/a>?** He RESIGNED today as manager of the Rangers for personal reasons. Jon Daniels says it ISN&amp;rsquo;T about drugs. But who knows? I wonder how the players are feeling?_&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OMG did you hear about the &lt;a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/nfl/rumors/post/_/id/24032/will-refs-pocket-flags-in-regular-season">number of penalties being called in NFL preseason&lt;/a>? I wonder if, like, the NFL will call those during the REGULAR SEASON!?!?! This might like change the whole game.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OMG, did you &lt;a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/denver-broncos/post/_/id/8501/wes-welker-roundup-everything-you-need-to-know-about-his-suspension">hear that Wes Welker&lt;/a> is SUSPENDED for FOUR GAMES for taking drugs? I wonder what drugs they are????&amp;hellip;!?!?!?!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is all of this about?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like the news, this is about sucking people into intrigue over things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter so they&amp;rsquo;ll be sitting there when the advertising comes on. &lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s about selling you stuff you normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t buy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does the nature of Ron Washington&amp;rsquo;s resignation matter? No.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is there any effect that you can have on the number of NFL penalties by reading the article? No. No effect. You. Are. Wasting. Your. Time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does it matter what Wes Welker did or did not do? To him and his family, it means he makes a few hundred thousand less from multiple millions. To us, it means nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It means nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let that sink in, sports fans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is entertainment. It&amp;rsquo;s not your life. It&amp;rsquo;s not your family. It&amp;rsquo;s not your livelihood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s a business run by people who make a lot of money tricking you into thinking it matters.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in perspective, by all means go to a game or watch it on TV and enjoy. But leave it at that, and find better things to do with your time. Over time, even that will begin to fade away.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Economist Keeps it Real</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-economist-keeps-it-real/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2014 08:00:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-economist-keeps-it-real/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-the-economist-keeps-it-real.jpg" alt="Economist" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Over the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to see &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/">the absolute insanity&lt;/a> of following the news on normal news sites like CNN or Fox News. You might be thinking that I have no clue what is going on in the world. I do value being an educated person who knows about world events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a secret weapon that helps me get this insight into the world without driving myself crazy day to day. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.subscriptionaddiction.com/magazines/subscription/the-economist-magazine-magazine.jsp">a paper subscription&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist magazine&lt;/a>. Here are seven things I love about having a paper subscription to The Economist:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>International.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s not focused on Americans only. I get more of an insight into the world than the typical American news outlets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Soap Opera Free.&lt;/strong> It doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to get me sucked into idiotic stories about how people are going to react to this or that, or worse what a celebrity was doing last Friday night. I want to be an educated man who knows world events…not a celebrity gossip connoisseur. The subscription keeps everything serious and leaves the rest out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Distraction Free.&lt;/strong> When I read the magazine, I don&amp;rsquo;t see emails popping up. My kids don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m playing video games. They know I&amp;rsquo;m reading a serious news magazine. And when I put it down, I do something else. I don&amp;rsquo;t get sucked into ten hours of mindless video watching. &lt;strong>This is a feature and not a bug.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not Republican or Democrat.&lt;/strong> I love it that I get out of the false American dichotomy of Republican and Democrat with the magazine. It has no interest in getting me to be &lt;em>more&lt;/em> one way or another. It just calls it like it sees it. Which is probably more of a Libertarian bent but honestly it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to tell sometimes. And that&amp;rsquo;s how I would like to take my news. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be told what to think. I want some facts and fair analysis and I want to think about it myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Weekly.&lt;/strong> I don&amp;rsquo;t think that the appropriate news cadence should be any more frequent than once a week. If something is important I&amp;rsquo;m going to find out about it. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend every day reading the news. It just doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that much. So the fact that the Economist is weekly is perfect for me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Guilt Free to Skip.&lt;/strong> This isn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; of the magazine as much as it is for me. If I had a weekly subscription and didn&amp;rsquo;t read &lt;em>any&lt;/em> of it, I still think it would be worth it. Why? Because it kept me from the hours per day of distraction I had been getting by going to news sites. So the Economist can be skipped just fine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Diversified.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s not just a political magazine. It also has stuff on business, technology, science. It has special features that bring you up to speed on a topic in depth.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I have subscribed to the Economist for months now and absolutely love it. I highly recommend you ditch your current news habit and buy an Economist subscription. I did some searching and found a deeply discounted deal &lt;a href="http://www.subscriptionaddiction.com/magazines/subscription/the-economist-magazine-magazine.jsp">here&lt;/a>. Try it and you&amp;rsquo;ll be hooked. If you run into me personally, I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to give you a copy so you can see what I&amp;rsquo;m saying; just ask.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Escaping with the News</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 08:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-escaping-with-the-news.jpg" alt="Escaping with the News" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I was having a great time at a party at my house recently, when a friend of mine who is quite conservative started talking to me about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack">the Benghazi incident of September 2012&lt;/a>. He went on and on about how outrageous it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I respond, &amp;ldquo;I just don&amp;rsquo;t see how any of this is important or relevant to my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With an outraged tone, he responds with eyes wide open in outrage, &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t think &lt;em>Benghazi&lt;/em> is important???&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To my life? No, I don&amp;rsquo;t. In fact I can take that a step further: &lt;strong>the news, especially political news is designed to get people to get outraged over things that are not in their power to change or influence.&lt;/strong> This state of frustration and anger puts them in a place where they are willing to buy more things in the advertisements, which is good for the provider of the outrageous news. But for the person who is consuming it, it is the very definition of a waste of time: spending time on something one doesn&amp;rsquo;t find enjoying, can&amp;rsquo;t do anything about, and causes them to act in ways that are outside of their values. This is insanity!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to propose we ask a question about every news article that we consume from now on: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>How will my life change as a result of me knowing this information?&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I propose the answer is, for the most part, &amp;ldquo;none at all&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To illustrate, let&amp;rsquo;s comment on some CNN and Fox News headlines as of the date of first writing this, July 26, 2014:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Story&lt;/th>
&lt;th>How will my life change as a result of me knowing this information&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/26/world/meast/mideast-crisis/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">Rockets fired; Israel-Hamas truce appears over&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. The rockets likely won&amp;rsquo;t make it to North Texas. There is no election today to influence our political establishment, and political leadership in the U.S. seem to be aligned (for the most part).&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/26/world/africa/libya-us-embassy-evacuation/index.html?hpt=hp_t2">U.S. evacuates embassy in Tripoli&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I am in North Texas, not Tripoli. I have nothing to be afraid of by whatever is happening there.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/26/joe-paterno-feared-wrongly-accusing-sandusky-son-says/?intcmp=latestnews">Joe Paterno Feared Wrongly Accusing Sandusky, Son Says&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I am not nor do I have any friends who are a part of this case. While it is a tragedy, me knowing about the state of mind of one of the participants of the case, who is now dead, will have no bearing on the outcome of the case whatsoever.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/26/officials-cite-marijuana-as-reason-for-rise-in-denver-homeless/?intcmp=latestnews">Officials cite marijuana as reason for rise in Denver homeless&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I live in North Texas, not Denver. I do not use marijuana. I suppose if I did this news article wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change my mind about it. There is no marijuana vote on the Texas ballot today for me to vote on.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/07/26/some-in-cia-torture-report-denied-chance-to-read-it/?intcmp=latestnews">Some in CIA &amp;lsquo;torture&amp;rsquo; report denied chance to read it&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I am not subject to torture or defining what torture is in the coming months as far as I know. In fact if I were to be tortured, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that this report would have anything to do with how I would be treated.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/26/colorado-business-owner-fights-back-after-falling-victim-to-caller-id-spoofing/?intcmp=latestnews">Colorado business owner fights back after falling victim to &amp;lsquo;caller ID spoofing'&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I have managed to live my life for 35 years without knowing what the term &amp;ldquo;caller id spoofing&amp;rdquo; means. Even if there were a risk, I suppose I would hear about it from the phone company. The fact that it&amp;rsquo;s on a news site tells me that it is a rare occurrence. Besides, I don&amp;rsquo;t even own a business so there is absolutely no chance of anything in this article affecting my life.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/26/fast-food-workers-vow-civil-disobedience-in-wage-fight/?intcmp=latestnews">Fast food workers vow civil disobedience in wage fight&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I don&amp;rsquo;t work at McDonald&amp;rsquo;s. I also don&amp;rsquo;t eat there very often. I suppose if their wages do go up, the price of a Happy Meal will eventually go up, thus creating an unexpected surprise on the rare occasion that I go to McDonalds. But we&amp;rsquo;re quite a ways from this: they are &lt;em>vowing &lt;/em>civil disobedience. Nothing has actually happened. This affects my life in no way whatsoever.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Let me give you a little guarantee: If you play this game for a few days on the news sites you are visiting, you will very quickly be awakened to the reality that this all is a complete and total waste of your time. &lt;strong>You are a pawn in someone else&amp;rsquo;s game to get you to buy stuff.&lt;/strong> There actually isn&amp;rsquo;t news on almost every day. And when there is it can be summed up in a ten second brief description.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So let&amp;rsquo;s stop investing so much time in &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; and make some &lt;em>real&lt;/em> news in our own lives.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Escaping</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/escaping/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2014 08:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/escaping/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-escaping.jpg" alt="Escaping" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I get home &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/">from work&lt;/a> and am daydreaming about a feature I need to add to my software as my son tells me about &lt;a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I finally have a few moments of free time and spend them reading about movie stars and wars on the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At work I have something really important to work on but I read the latest tech news instead, and I get involved in a long conversation with a colleague about office politics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is going on here?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it&amp;rsquo;s simple: &lt;strong>real life is lived right here and right now with the choices you make.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s not at work when you&amp;rsquo;re at home. It&amp;rsquo;s not with movie stars. It&amp;rsquo;s not in office politics. It&amp;rsquo;s not even on Facebook. It&amp;rsquo;s in your own choices &lt;em>right now.&lt;/em>****&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our problem is that many of us don&amp;rsquo;t like or are scared of the choices we have in front of us. If we were really honest with ourselves we&amp;rsquo;d have to admit that we just don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with our &lt;em>true&lt;/em> lives. We really want an escape.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I run away from my present choices and go somewhere else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At home I go to work or to the lives of famous people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At work I move away from important decisions to politics or the unimportant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When relating to others I am preoccupied with my Facebook or Twitter status.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or I keep thinking about how everything will be better in the future once my plans come to fruition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is insanity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you want a &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/">beautiful life&lt;/a> of meaning and purpose?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Stop running away from it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this you&amp;rsquo;ll need to set up a lifestyle that blocks out those distractions that keep you &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">from what truly matters&lt;/a>. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to figure out how to ignore the news. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to figure out how to stop checking your phone like a crack addict every five minutes. &lt;strong>You&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn how to live a life that is present in what is happening &lt;em>right now&lt;/em> in &lt;em>your life&lt;/em>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the journey I&amp;rsquo;m on, and I&amp;rsquo;m by no means perfect at it. We&amp;rsquo;re in this together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are you running from? And what are you using to distract yourself from what really matters?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finding a Philosophy of Life</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/finding-a-philosophy-of-life/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2014 08:00:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/finding-a-philosophy-of-life/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-finding-a-philosophy-of-life.jpg" alt="Finding Philosophy of Life" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We realize that the &lt;em>default&lt;/em> cultural script &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/our-cultures-script/">does not deliver on its promises&lt;/a>. We need a new one. We need a &lt;em>philosophy of life.&lt;/em> We need a framework of values and prescriptions that we can use as a starting point for living out our lives in such a way that they will be &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/">a beautiful work of art&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before we get into the specifics of evaluating a &lt;em>particular&lt;/em> philosophy of life, I&amp;rsquo;ll define my requirements for it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Christian but Universal.&lt;/strong> The philosophy I find must conform to my Christian faith. I need to be able to combine meaning I get from my life&amp;rsquo;s pursuits with ultimate meaning I get by faith within my religion. At the same time, we all live in the same world and deal with the same human condition, so the philosophy of life must be as universally applicable as possible. If I had a choice between an approach that &lt;em>only&lt;/em> worked for my denomination or religion and an approach that worked for everyone, I&amp;rsquo;ll pick the latter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Achievable Right Now.&lt;/strong> This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be something I need to spend twenty years on in order to see results. I should be able to see results from following the philosophy of life right now. I don&amp;rsquo;t have two thousand years to experiment, so results must happen quickly, and I must be able to adjust the plan. I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to just &amp;ldquo;trust&amp;rdquo; that in decades the &lt;em>real&lt;/em> results will come through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Relational.&lt;/strong> If a philosophy of life tells me to live life by living alone on a mountain for decades, it&amp;rsquo;s the wrong one for me. I must relate to others. I must love my wife and family more. I must grow in serving and helping others. I must be motivated to help my community and those who are less fortunate than I am.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Historical.&lt;/strong> If a philosophy of life is something someone just dreamed up, it&amp;rsquo;s probably not going to work. Human condition in the civilized world has not changed &lt;em>so much&lt;/em> in the last two to three thousand years that we can&amp;rsquo;t rely on the wisdom of those who have gone before us. So a philosophy of life isn&amp;rsquo;t something I should &lt;em>create&lt;/em>; it should be something I &lt;em>discover&lt;/em>, and then tweak to fit my specifics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Moral.&lt;/strong> It must be something that enables me to be a better person and do good for others. It should be centered around love, which selflessly looks at the interests of others above one&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Those are my requirements for finding a philosophy of life that will lead to happiness and meaning in my life. I&amp;rsquo;m sure yours are different. My question for you, before we dig deeper into this journey, is &lt;strong>what are your requirements for a philosophy of life?&lt;/strong> Are they different than mine? If so, how?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our Culture's Script</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/our-cultures-script/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 08:00:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/our-cultures-script/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-our-cultures-script.jpg" alt="Our Culture Script" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We want our lives to be &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/">a work of art&lt;/a> and reflect the beauty and meaning of our values. Most of us in search of meaning in our lives will naturally absorb our culture&amp;rsquo;s script for us:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>To create a beautiful work of art, you must feel good. To feel good, first you must make good money. You need to go to school and then get a good, stable job.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Once you get the job, start maximizing convenience. Pay for things you no longer want to do, including mowing the lawn, making meals, washing your car, fixing your house, going to the store. You work hard so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do these things.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Also, make sure you are as comfortable as possible. Get a nice big house you can be comfortable in, a nice, new car with leather seats that feel great, and stop at the ice cream store and give yourself a treat that makes you feel like a kid again. You deserve it because you work hard.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You won&amp;rsquo;t be happy unless other people respect and want to be like you. So when you get a car, get something that will show everyone how hard you have worked. When you go on vacation, make sure it&amp;rsquo;s something totally awesome that will show how you have great taste and can afford the finer things in life. You want to be the best you can be. You&amp;rsquo;ve worked hard for this.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You need to be happy. That&amp;rsquo;s what life is about. So make as much money as possible and spend that mainly on three things: convenience so you can focus on the things that really matter, comfort so you won&amp;rsquo;t be distracted by annoyances and pain and can focus on enjoying life, and respect so you can be validated that you have done something meaningful with your life.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this? Well, nothing if it works. The problem is, when we think through this approach we don&amp;rsquo;t actually see anyone reaping its benefits. Instead we see millionaires that need more. Actors who are on drugs. Affairs. It&amp;rsquo;s an absolute mess out there. There&amp;rsquo;s never an end. There&amp;rsquo;s never enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t a good way to create a life of meaning and value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to sell stuff though.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This script does nothing about the biggest human problem: &lt;strong>no matter how much you have today, you always need more.&lt;/strong> Once you realize that, the above description becomes silly. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEY58fiSK8E">You&amp;rsquo;ll never have too much convenience&lt;/a>. No matter how much comfort you have, you know people who have more and that makes you feel…uncomfortable. There will always be someone who gets more respect than you do. Your needs are &lt;em>insatiable.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is unavoidable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution? &lt;strong>Accept insatiability as a fact of life,&lt;/strong> dealing with it on a regular basis, and you will have a shot at sanity. How do you do this? Keep reading to find out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Empathy</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/empathy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2014 08:00:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/empathy/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-empathy.jpg" alt="Empathy" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A few months ago we were at my mom&amp;rsquo;s house eating dinner. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know my mom, she&amp;rsquo;s an awesome cook. She had made one of my favorite meals of all time: meatloaf with green beans and mashed potatoes. I was in heaven.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Oh gross,&amp;rdquo; the middle child exclaimed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Parental embarrassment ensued, and then we got to talking about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mom talked about how her dad&amp;rsquo;s rule as he was growing up was that no one complains about food. If you do, you&amp;rsquo;re just going to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">have to figure out&lt;/a> a way to make it to the next meal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was my mom&amp;rsquo;s rule growing up. Complain and wait until the next meal to eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And from that day onward that has been our rule. You don&amp;rsquo;t complain about food. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to like it. But be polite and don&amp;rsquo;t whine about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of days ago we sat down to tamales, rice, and corn, and the middle child was being a pickle about the tamales. He stepped over the line and Mom said, &amp;ldquo;You may be excused&amp;rdquo;, which is code for, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not eating until breakfast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He sat there and cried and the look on his face of ‘I will not be eating for another 12 hours and I was already starting to feel hungry&amp;rsquo; was in full force.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I felt truly bad for him. He made a mistake.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that you can&amp;rsquo;t really relate to your children with love until you learn how to truly empathize with their mistakes. A few days ago I had a breakthrough in that. &lt;strong>My middle son needed to learn how to treat others. But he also had to deal with a bad situation.&lt;/strong> Taking away the consequence wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been empathetic: if there&amp;rsquo;s no pain in which to share, then there is no empathy. But also acting coldly towards him with a &amp;ldquo;this is how it is&amp;rdquo; attitude isn&amp;rsquo;t empathetic either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My wife saw that I had felt bad for my son, and she interpreted it as questioning her judgement on the consequence. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t it at all. &lt;strong>Empathy holds this strange place in between allowing consequences and loving others.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Empathy is when you share in someone&amp;rsquo;s suffering. It&amp;rsquo;s something I discovered a few days ago with my son and something that will transform my relationship with all three of them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Life is Art</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2014 08:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-life-is-art.jpg" alt="Life is Art" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Earlier this year, I was pretty excited about some &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">drastic changes&lt;/a> we had made in our lifestyle. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m excited about something, I must tell someone and my friend at a dinner party at my house was no exception. I excitedly pointed out all the ways that simplicity has led us to a life of greater contentment and tranquility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could sense my friend becoming increasingly uncomfortable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Well, not everyone can live that way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friend assumed that I view life as a science; that there are certain rules that &lt;em>must&lt;/em> be followed and a right and wrong way to do things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I completely disagree with that notion. To me &lt;strong>life is more like a work of art.&lt;/strong> You have a canvas on which to paint decisions, consequences, and ultimately meaning. Every life is as different as every work of art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a painter presents her painting, she is expressing herself in a unique way that is unlike anyone else. The painter has &lt;em>her&lt;/em> way of painting. To her it &lt;em>feels&lt;/em> like the right way, because, of course, she did it that way. Another painter may do it totally differently. A wonderful and mysterious thing happens in the gallery: &lt;strong>each painter admires the brilliance and beauty in the other&amp;rsquo;s work of art.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I am creating a work of art that I hope to be beautiful and meaningful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not creating a life of the entrepreneur who spends her nights and weekends creating a groundbreaking service that improves the lives of millions of people. But I can appreciate her work of art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not creating a life of the philanthropist who travels the world to find a way to cure malaria worldwide. But I can appreciate his work of art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not creating a life of the video game developer who works for two solid years to create a game that captures the imagination of a teenager who stays out of trouble because he has something to do when he&amp;rsquo;s out of school. But I can appreciate his work of art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not creating a life of a hospice nurse who works the night shift helping dying patients find dignity and meaning in their final days. But I can appreciate her work of art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m creating a life of tranquility, meaning, and purpose. I do this through simplifying life in every facet, achieving in the marketplace through a fearless pursuit of adding value, and creating margin in my life to build a legacy with those around me, especially my family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my work of art. This is the journey I will share with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It isn&amp;rsquo;t the only way.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I want it to be beautiful, and I want to share it with you because I hope we can inspire each other to make our lives a beautiful work of art.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting There with Metro Arlington Express (MAX)</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/getting-there-with-metro-arlington-express-max/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2014 08:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/getting-there-with-metro-arlington-express-max/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-getting-there-with-metro-arlington-express-max.jpg" alt="Failure Masquerading as Success" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Last week my family spent the week at my childhood home in Arlington with my mom. We had a great week of organization, projects, and best of all: &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/empathy/">my favorite food&lt;/a> from my childhood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My mom lives in Central Arlington, southwest of UTA. I work near the &lt;a href="http://www.trinityrailwayexpress.org/stationsdetail.html?item_id=5">TRE Centreport station&lt;/a>, so I decided to try something a bit different:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t take my car for the entire week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How did I do this, you ask? By taking advantage of an awesome new service in Arlington: &lt;a href="http://www.ridethemax.com/">the Metro Arlington Express (MAX)&lt;/a>. The line goes from the east side of the UTA campus, stops at Collins, and drops off at the TRE station, 300 yards from my work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought I would review the experience for those who are interested in what it is like and may want to take advantage of it themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What I liked about it:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bike rack on the bus.&lt;/strong> I was able to ride up to the bus, pull the bike rack down, and put my bike on the bus. It was a great experience for a cyclist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Riding through UTA and historic Arlington.&lt;/strong> I love the university feel of UTA. Every day I chose a new route to ride. The houses around UTA are also great to see. I enjoyed the scenery a ton.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Simple payment.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s $5 for a day pass. I had $5 bills ready to go and bought one a day. It was easier than a normal situation where the amount differs from factors you don&amp;rsquo;t understand. (A monthly pass is $70 to have access to all of DART.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Free internet.&lt;/strong> When I entered the bus, I opened my laptop and was able to get some work done or work on writing my blog posts. I felt like I was able to get back some time that I normally just spend in traffic.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Flexible schedule for coming and going.&lt;/strong> The bus is running all day, so I can flexibly go back whenever I need to. I&amp;rsquo;m not locked in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Flexibility with minor tardiness.&lt;/strong> The bus driver will stop if you&amp;rsquo;re running up to it and have just missed the bus. This happened to others, and it happened to me as well. I was grateful for the grace that they showed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Someone was DRIVING ME TO WORK.&lt;/strong> This is a service that only the ultra-wealthy were able to enjoy just 100 years ago. But now for $5, someone else will drive me to work. It&amp;rsquo;s really amazing. I got to sit there, not worry about traffic, directions, safety, or even timing. All that was handled for me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Popularity.&lt;/strong> The buses were about half full, which is what you want. People really use this in their every day lives. I was scared that I would be the only person on a bus because Arlington hasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly been a mass transit friendly place. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case. There were plenty of people who use this for their everyday commute, but not too many to make it crowded.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Better options.&lt;/strong> For me this is a choice I have made, but it was so good seeing people without cars freed up to go where they needed to go. One day I spoke with a lady and her two children. The lady was trying to find a school to attend so she could get a better job. I met so many UTA students when I was a student there who were just stuck in Central Arlington. They now have the option to go to Dallas and Fort Worth. I think this is a wonderful addition to Arlington.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What can improve:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall it was a great experience. There were only three things that bothered me even a bit about it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>** Bus Driver Friendliness.** Why are mass transit drivers so unfriendly? This is Texas. Smile, say hi, welcome. And when I ask you a question, provide a polite answer. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is anything really bad about the MAX experience that is out of the ordinary. Just for some reason bus drivers usually seem like they are mad at someone. The exception to this was Chavez who was very nice to everyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Internet Connectivity.&lt;/strong> The internet goes out during parts of the trip. So generally I had to do disconnected work like blogging in Word or email.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cost.&lt;/strong> The gas to drive me there is cheaper than the $5 round trip. So financially speaking it is not competitive for the MAX ride itself. It becomes worth it when you transfer into Dallas or Fort Worth. Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t do this, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to save any money. I did this to ride my bike to work and go without a car. I would have liked to have an option to make my situation financially competitive with driving.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If I lived in Arlington, I would definitely use the MAX every day instead of a car. It is a wonderful service that brings a component of transportation that has been lacking for many years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting Things Done Action Plan</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/getting-things-done-action-plan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2014 08:00:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/getting-things-done-action-plan/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-getting-things-done-action-plan.jpg" alt="GTD Action Plan" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>So you&amp;rsquo;ve been reading along and you want &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/mind-like-water/">to implement GTD&lt;/a> for yourself, but you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start. I&amp;rsquo;ve been there before. More than once. I&amp;rsquo;ve started, then stopped, then started again. What do I tell people to do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>First, Collect Everything.&lt;/strong> Go through your entire life: your email, mail, closet, garage…everything. Put it all in an inbox. Make a list of everything on your mind and put &lt;em>that&lt;/em> in your inbox. You want to get everything out of your mind and into your system. Now that you have it all in once place, you&amp;rsquo;ll:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Get All Inboxes Empty.&lt;/strong> Take everything off the top and process it as we went over in the process post. No exceptions. You may not pay that bill right now (but if it takes 2 minutes you should), but you&amp;rsquo;ll have it in your system to do it later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Decide Your Yes.&lt;/strong> you now have a big list. You were saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to quite a bit of that list, so it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be any different than it was before. Only now you&amp;rsquo;re going to be conscious about it. So what do you want to do someday? What do you want to do now? What are your focuses? Put the things you want to focus on in a list with your name. I have a michael list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Share and Delegate.&lt;/strong> Do you need to do everything? If not, create another list and share it with that person. Talk with them about your joint goals and get agreement on what to do next and when. Set due dates and follow up. I have a &amp;ldquo;home&amp;rdquo; list for home projects with my wife, and a &amp;ldquo;money&amp;rdquo; list for financial stuff that needs to be done with my wife. At work I have a list for every project I&amp;rsquo;m working on and share with the people who are on that project. Not everyone updates or is involved, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised at how receptive people are to having a project plan right there for them to think about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Review Regularly.&lt;/strong> Set recurring tasks in &lt;a href="https://checkvist.com/">Checkvist&lt;/a> to review your lists or a calendar if you don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re going to check it. Reviewing is key to the GTD methodology so do something that will get you looking at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Keep Saying No.&lt;/strong> Every day you&amp;rsquo;re going to say no to stuff. You should get comfortable with that. The minute you think &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that today&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s due today, change or remove the due date! &lt;strong>You have the power to make Checkvist show reality&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>by all means let it show you reality!&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t settle with wishes when reality is just a few edits away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope you get as much out of GTD and Checkvist as I have. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear how your implementation goes if you&amp;rsquo;re convinced that you need to try this. I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that GTD isn&amp;rsquo;t about the tool and so you can implement it any number of ways. However, Checkvist is the best one out there, hands down!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mind Like Water</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/mind-like-water/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2014 08:00:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/mind-like-water/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-mind-like-water.jpg" alt="Mind Like Water" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The result of &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/productivity/">Getting Things Done&lt;/a>, when implemented properly, is &amp;ldquo;Mind Like Water&amp;rdquo;. When I first heard the term, I thought it meant, &amp;ldquo;peaceful, still, quiet.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s pretty silly though because water is in many &lt;em>other&lt;/em> states as well, just as often!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What &lt;em>Mind Like Water&lt;/em> really means is that you &lt;em>appropriately&lt;/em> react to your world. If a small pebble is thrown into a pond, it makes a small splash. If a large boulder is hurled into that same pond, it&amp;rsquo;s going to make a huge splash. This is how our minds should work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The problem is we get tricked into reacting to pebbles as if they are boulders.&lt;/strong> How to get out of it? Let&amp;rsquo;s review the system:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Collect&lt;/strong> helps you know that you can get to it later, and focus on the things that are happening now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Process/Organize&lt;/strong> helps you get the small things off your plate so you can focus, and organize the large things into actionable steps you know you will come back to later.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Review&lt;/strong> is the essential piece where you start trusting that you will indeed remind yourself of things that you thought of before and take appropriate action. So for now, relax and focus!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Do you see a pattern? Everything in this system is oriented around you forgetting about everything around you and focusing on the next important thing. When a big thing comes along, you collect it, process it into your system, and do it. You appropriately react to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of the pieces of the system must be in place for you to reach this state of tranquility and productivity. And I only reached it when I used &lt;a href="https://checkvist.com/">Checkvist&lt;/a>, because that was the only system where I could get a good review workflow going and it is so adaptable because of its free form structure and keyboard centricity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The strange thing about GTD is the lack of focus on organizing what you do. Other systems will focus on prioritization, or assigning an &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; to the most important things. With Checkvist and GTD, once you organize your outcomes into actionable steps, and trust that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep juggling a million things, &lt;em>what you need to do becomes obvious.&lt;/em> What do I need to do today? Let me review my lists and the most important thing will pop out at me. I&amp;rsquo;ll say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to all the rest by delegating them or saving them for later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no need for priority codes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no need to make it bold, or red, or flashing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system will work, and will tell you what to do. So get to work and get something done!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review the Glue</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/review-the-glue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2014 08:00:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/review-the-glue/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-review-the-glue.jpg" alt="Review the Glue" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It happened to me over and over again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got sick and tired of being disorganized, of missing things, of not meeting my goals. &amp;ldquo;I am going to make a system.&amp;rdquo; I wrote everything I need to do down in a to-do list. I made sure my emails get processed correctly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And a few weeks later it was as if none of that ever happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why did this happen to me over and over again? Unlocking this secret was the key to actually implementing Getting Things Done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the key: &lt;strong>your system won&amp;rsquo;t work unless there is a place in it for you to review what you have processed.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about what we talked about earlier regarding your cluttered mind. You can&amp;rsquo;t tell your mind, &amp;ldquo;Stop thinking about that, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to it later&amp;rdquo; unless it can trust that you &lt;em>will&lt;/em> get to it later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about the empty inbox. Are you &lt;em>really&lt;/em> going to put that important email in the @Actions folder if you don&amp;rsquo;t trust that you&amp;rsquo;ll keep it there? No. What you&amp;rsquo;ll do instead is keep the &lt;em>important&lt;/em> emails in your inbox because, really, you don&amp;rsquo;t have a review system in place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where &lt;a href="https://checkvist.com">Checkvist&lt;/a> really shines for me. I review items in Checkvist two ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Due Dates.&lt;/strong> If I need to get something done within a certain amount of time, I&amp;rsquo;ll set its due date. Every day I&amp;rsquo;ll check the &amp;ldquo;Due&amp;rdquo; screen (shortcut dd) and make sure I&amp;rsquo;m not missing anything. I&amp;rsquo;ll even set due dates on items that I &lt;em>commit&lt;/em> to doing by that time. For example no one is forcing me to read a book by August 1, but I put that as a due date to tell myself that is my goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Review Repeating Task.&lt;/strong> I set up a task called &amp;ldquo;Review [list]&amp;quot;* for every list I have that recurs as often as I need to review it. For example, I have a &amp;ldquo;Review money&amp;rdquo; task that recurs every Sunday and Wednesday with financial tasks on it. This is &amp;ldquo;Due&amp;rdquo; those days, so it will shows up in my due list that I&amp;rsquo;m checking from the above point. This way I only have to remember: every day look at my due list, which will tell me that I need to review my list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s my system. Other people can schedule meetings with themselves but that never worked for me. I need to review the areas of my life more regularly than that. And, as one who has tons of projects going on both personally and professionally, I have an even more complicated workflow that I&amp;rsquo;ll share in a future post regarding my reviews. But the above system I think works as well as anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bottom line is &lt;strong>make sure you have a system to review things, or else you don&amp;rsquo;t have a system.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Hint: When you set up the review task, type &amp;ldquo;Review [lst:&amp;rdquo; and the list will pop up. Select the list and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to navigate to the list with the gg shortcut.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Process and Organize</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/process-and-organize/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2014 08:00:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/process-and-organize/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-process-and-organize.jpg" alt="Process and Organize" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When I get home from work, I always go to my mailbox, take a few letters off of the top of my pile, open them, and put them back in the mailbox for later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Said no one ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to me though that is exactly what people do with email. This is insanity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order for you to have sanity in your life, you need a system that tells you, &amp;ldquo;What of my life have I put in my system to act on later, and what do I need to do so I can take action on them at the appropriate time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the process and organize phase of Getting Things Done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I do it: I go to each of the collection places I set up in the Collect Phase (physical inboxes, evernote, and email accounts), and follow this workflow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Is this actionable? Is there anything I need to do with this at any conceivable point ever?&lt;/strong> If not I should delete it or store it for reference, but my experience with this item is GONE FOREVER. I will never see this again and it will not invade my life ever again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Can I do it in two minutes or less?&lt;/strong> If I can then I do it. There&amp;rsquo;s no sense of creating a to-do list item for &amp;ldquo;Reply &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; to email, &amp;ldquo;Are you coming tonight?&amp;rdquo; That would be silly. So keep it simple and get stuff out of the way that will just overload your system.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>What actions need to be taken for this to be done?&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to say &amp;ldquo;Pool care&amp;rdquo; in your list. You have to have your list contain &lt;em>actions&lt;/em>, not just stuff. The action might be &amp;ldquo;Call the pool care company to schedule a filter cleaning.&amp;rdquo; Or it might even be &amp;ldquo;Search for a pool care company to help me with filter cleaning.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s not &lt;em>stuff&lt;/em>, it&amp;rsquo;s actions.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Add the actions into &lt;a href="http://www.checkvist.com">Checkvist&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong> I add whatever comes to my mind to finish what the item in my inbox represents into Checkvist. At first I recommend just having a &amp;ldquo;To Do&amp;rdquo; list in Checkvist and make it complicated later. You are dumping everything into that program because that is going to be your one-stop-shop for getting things done.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Archive the item.&lt;/strong> It doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay in the inbox. Archive it. Move it to a folder. Whatever. But you will never see this again unless you need to. In this system there is a clear distinction between &lt;em>what is processed&lt;/em> and &lt;em>what needs to be processed.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Some more notes about this system:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I process my items from the top down, with few exceptions.&lt;/strong> This is important because in this workflow, you aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>doing&lt;/em> anything; you&amp;rsquo;re just processing your items. If you think, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get to this because it will take too long to do.&amp;rdquo; Well in that case, add the item to your list! I have an @Actions folder for these situations, so I know I can go to the email and write in a long response.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>My email inbox has zero items in it at some point every day.&lt;/strong> You think I&amp;rsquo;m crazy, I know. Believe me, once you do this workflow, you won&amp;rsquo;t ever go back. I&amp;rsquo;ve been told by people higher up than me that the email gets unbearable and that my workflow is impossible. I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that it isn&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;ve already started forwarding emails to people on my team with short responses: &amp;ldquo;Yours&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Let me know if I need to do anything&amp;rdquo;. Most threads I&amp;rsquo;m copied on aren&amp;rsquo;t important. So I think that this should apply to everyone, and you &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to know what it is you need to get done in your life to have sanity in any way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The key to processing is translating &amp;ldquo;Stuff&amp;rdquo; into Actions.&lt;/strong> I can tell when someone really knows GTD by the items on their to-do list. &amp;ldquo;Set up blog&amp;rdquo; becomes &amp;ldquo;Buy domain on BlueHost&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Set up Genesis Theme on blog&amp;rdquo; and about fifty other things. How much faster do I burn through the fifty specific, actionable things, than my &amp;ldquo;Set up blog&amp;rdquo;? Honestly, for me &amp;ldquo;Set up Blog&amp;rdquo; goes nowhere, because &amp;ldquo;watch episode of Biggest Loser&amp;rdquo; is much more actionable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you think inbox zero will work in your situation? If not, why not?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Collect for Sanity</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/collect-for-sanity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2014 08:00:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/collect-for-sanity/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>We are inundated with stuff. Stuff we need to act on. Stuff we need to remember. Stuff we need to worry about later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of us are stressed out with the amount of stuff in our lives. What to do about it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system outlined in Getting Things Done starts with collection: &lt;strong>there needs to be a system in your life for putting things that need to be processed later.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when you&amp;rsquo;re driving down the road and think of something, what is your system for collecting that for later? When you get a bill in the mail, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay it, what is your system for that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without this system &lt;strong>your mind will always be reminding you about everything.&lt;/strong> And you will never find peace. You will constantly be running from thing to thing and never able to say to yourself, &amp;ldquo;Relax, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to it later.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong>Because your mind knows you won&amp;rsquo;t, because you don&amp;rsquo;t have a system for it.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is where I collect things to be processed later:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Inbox at home.&lt;/strong> All my mail, bills, go here&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Inbox at work.&lt;/strong> All my physical meeting notes, receipts go here&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evernote.&lt;/strong> all my digital meeting notes go here&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Gmail Inbox.&lt;/strong> All my personal email goes here&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Outlook Inbox.&lt;/strong> All my work email goes here&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If I want something to be processed in my life, they &lt;em>must&lt;/em> go here. If I put them here, I can forget about them, because I have a system to deal with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out a system for yet, but want to: daydreaming away from my computer. For this system to &lt;em>really&lt;/em> work, you have to empty your mind of all your stuff into a system. Anything that you ignore will come back over and over again. In the process phase you can say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to those things, but the key is that you tell your mind, &amp;ldquo;Forget about it. It&amp;rsquo;s in the system. Trust me.&amp;rdquo; This frees you up to &lt;em>truly focus.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right now I have no system for when I&amp;rsquo;m thinking in the car and realize, &amp;ldquo;I need to organize my closet.&amp;rdquo; Normally I forget about it by the time I arrive at my destination, and my mind gets stuck in a loop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The obvious solution to this would be my phone, but a lot of times it&amp;rsquo;s locked and difficult to get to. Another solution might be a portable recording device. I think I might experiment with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Has anyone come up with a good system for dealing with these times when you&amp;rsquo;re away from your inboxes or computers?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Planned Thinking</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/planned-thinking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 08:00:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/planned-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>In 2012 our efforts to add automated integrated testing to our central Point-of-Sale product were showing great results. We &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/">were finding 20-40%&lt;/a> of all defects found in the software, many of which were found within hours of those defects being introduced by the developer. It took years of hard work to get to this place, and I was feeling good about our accomplishments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there was a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was running everything on adrenaline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was working extra hours, reacting to everything, and doing the next best thing to be done. But I was neglecting other really big things. It was review time and my boss wanted me to take my capabilities to another level. His advice was among the more valuable I&amp;rsquo;ve had in a review:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You need to stop at least once a week and think about things. You just need to stop and think&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My goodness he was right. And I knew better than this. Years ago I read the book Getting Things Done (GTD for short), which revolutionized how I did things. My problem was that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t developed a system for GTD principles. In the last year and a half I&amp;rsquo;ve focused on growing this area. I&amp;rsquo;m so excited to share with you my system, because I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great one that illustrates the concepts in GTD that I have only recently taken to the next level. If you read the book you get a good overview of the system. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe you really understand it until you see a system in practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The center of my GTD system is &lt;a href="http://www.checkvist.com">Checkvist&lt;/a>. I met the creator a Checkvist a little over two years ago at Jetbrains when I was discussing TeamCity with them. Kirill was taking notes in Checkvist and copied me on it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the tool seriously until after the review at the start of 2013. This tool is the single biggest reason for my success in the last 18 months. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine life without Checkvist. In fact, this blog is managed through Checkvist and helped me create a workable plan that I could execute on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are five phases of Getting Things Done that I will cover in detail in four posts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Collect:&lt;/strong> how do you take the things in your life and put them in places that you know you&amp;rsquo;ll get to when you have time?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Process/Organize:&lt;/strong> Now that you have time, how do you take the things you have collected and put them in a system that you trust you will come back to later?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Review:&lt;/strong> what is your system for coming back to the things you&amp;rsquo;ve put in your system?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Do:&lt;/strong> when you&amp;rsquo;re going to do something, what is your system for knowing what is best?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet checked out Checkvist. I encourage you to do so and follow along in the next couple of weeks to get yourself organized. I&amp;rsquo;m here to help!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Growth Got Me Organized and Productive</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/productivity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 08:00:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/productivity/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you keep learning and growing every day over the course of many years, you will be astounded by how far it will take you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As I read this in the introduction of John Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1599953668/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1599953668&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=hedgeopscom-20">12 Indisputable Laws of Growth&lt;/a>, I realized how &lt;strong>low my expectations were&lt;/strong>. At first I didn&amp;rsquo;t believe Maxwell. My focus at the time was more on keeping it together and making the &amp;ldquo;next logical step&amp;rdquo; than on reaching a destination I didn&amp;rsquo;t previously think was possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I took Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s advice and have focused on growth ever since. I&amp;rsquo;ve read books. I got a mentor. I pressed into my work and made things happen. I built my team so it isn&amp;rsquo;t just me anymore having to do the major things; it is&amp;quot;we&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>After two years of intentional growth, I can see Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s wisdom firsthand.&lt;/strong> I have grown so much in these two years and feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve only begun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest area of growth is with my &lt;strong>productivity and organization&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other day I reviewed everything that was going on and took an action on one of my many projects. I went to talk with person, who was on the phone, so I stopped to say hi to a friend of mine. He was questioning out loud how much my team had taken on and how it seemed impossible. Two years ago it would have been impossible. But now it is working, because I have focused on growing as a leader and because I have focused on creating a system within which I can manage what needs to happen in my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week I have six different projects at work going at the same time (and one project itself has three different subprojects). At home we are going through an amazing amount of change that is planned based on our newfound desire for &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/" title="Achievable Contentment">contentment&lt;/a>. On the surface it feels like I have five different jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, I have a secret weapon I use to keep my sanity: &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.checkvist.com">Checkvist&lt;/a> and the Getting Things Done methodology.&lt;/strong> This will be the focus of the next couple of weeks. But for now, open your mind to the possibility that if you intentionally grow over time, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do things you previously thought weren&amp;rsquo;t even possible. All that&amp;rsquo;s needed is that you start.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July Blog Update</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/july-2014-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 08:00:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/july-2014-update/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Taos, New Mexico with my family and have been thinking a lot about things. I thought it would be a good time to share with you more about where I&amp;rsquo;ve been, where I&amp;rsquo;m going, and what you can do to help me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="a-retrospective">A Retrospective&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When I planned out how I would start my blog, I planned five different series of posts, four of which have been published:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction:&lt;/strong> This shares some of my core values and lets you get to know me a bit. I naturally gravitated toward &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">contentment&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-masquerading-as-success/">appropriate definition of success&lt;/a>. These topics have still remained very interesting to me and were fun to write. I think these posts are probably the closest to where I think this blog is headed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lessons Learned on my Install/Diagnostic Utility project:&lt;/strong> This coincided with speaking about it. These posts weren&amp;rsquo;t very popular; the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/">safety net&lt;/a> post barely hit the top twenty. I had thought that there might be some more interest in the work-related sphere for lessons learned/etc., but there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Finances:&lt;/strong> Next I wrote about our financial story, which has played a big part in my character development in the last five years. This series was the most popular one, largely because I shared it on the &lt;a href="http://forum.youneedabudget.com/discussion/31368/success-story-posted-on-my-blog">You Need a Budget forum&lt;/a>. It was fun to write, especially when I write about the philosophy and mindset &lt;em>behind&lt;/em> making good financial decisions. I don&amp;rsquo;t read very many people writing about that, and think I may have insights in that area that can help people. The most popular posts in this series are also the most popular posts in the first two months: &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/">the introduction to the story&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/month-ahead/">how I got a month ahead with YNAB&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lessons learned on my long-term Autopilot project:&lt;/strong> This coincided with speaking about it to our User Summit in Huntington Beach. The lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned have been valuable to me and I enjoyed sharing them, but my audience shrank during this series. This highlights a key surprise from the first couple of months: I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to get any traction or response from what I do professionally. If I talk broadly about what I do professionally, people enjoy it, but the more detailed I get the less response I get from it. That&amp;rsquo;s a strange reality that I want to understand more deeply, but I won&amp;rsquo;t do an entire series related just to a work environment before I know that it will be well received.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Getting Things Done:&lt;/strong> The next series I will write about how &lt;a href="http://checkvist.com">Checkvist&lt;/a> has helped me implement the Getting Things Done system and has increased my productivity to previously unimaginable levels. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about this series because using this tool has created a breakthrough for me that has truly been revolutionary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-purpose">My Purpose&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I write this blog for four reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I want to create a network of people who want to grow and intentionally live a better life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to grow as a writer and a speaker because I enjoy helping others win.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to help the vendors who have made me successful, giving back to those who have given so much to me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to explore which of my ideas and passions resonates with an audience so I can know which paths my career can take me.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So far I have learned a ton and have enjoyed the work that has gone into this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-future">The Future&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I can already tell by how this first two months have gone that I want to write more about intentional, contented living. I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few books on this and will unpack it in August and beyond. I&amp;rsquo;m seeing by the response that these types of posts are the most helpful to people, and they are the most fulfilling for me to write.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-i-want-from-you">&lt;strong>What do I want from you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Subscribe to my email updates.&lt;/strong> This is on the right side of the posts and is the easiest way to be a regular reader.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tell people about posts you like.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s really encouraging to see responses in social media/etc., so the more you do this the more you support what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and encourage me. Use the icons on the bottom of each post to easily do this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Comment/Respond.&lt;/strong> If you&amp;rsquo;re an early reader of my blog and you like what I&amp;rsquo;m writing, you&amp;rsquo;re an important part of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. If you like something, please tell me through a comment or &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/contact/">contact me&lt;/a>. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like a particular post or idea, tell me that too! It&amp;rsquo;s helpful to be able to hear from you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you one way or another: &lt;strong>What about the first couple of months have you enjoyed the most? What would you like to read more about?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solve Problems by Isolating Them</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/solve-problems-by-isolating-them/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2014 08:02:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/solve-problems-by-isolating-them/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>It turns out there is a [My kids have been drawn into the world of Legos. They love &lt;a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/ninjago">Ninjago&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/">The Lego Movie&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out there is a &lt;a href="http://www.legolanddiscoverycenter.com/dallasfw/">Legoland Discovery center&lt;/a> nearby. The other day they went to a birthday party there. The kids had an absolute blast. Legos, legos everywhere. It was totally awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also turns out that we have a &lt;a href="https://www.sixflags.com/overtexas">Six Flags&lt;/a> nearby. Fast roller coasters. Every amusement park craziness imaginable. We spent last summer doing that, and let me tell you, mom and I really got sick of it. But the kids absolutely loved it. They even wanted to do it again this summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So DFW area: lego land: check. amusement park: check. &lt;a href="http://california.legoland.com/">lego amusement park&lt;/a>? That will be a trip to California and $4000 please.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how &lt;strong>the solution to a problem gets a lot more complicated and a lot more expensive when you combine it with another problem.&lt;/strong> I come across this a lot at work. I ruthlessly go through a project and eliminate anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t needed, because I want to ship it as quickly as possible and I know every little thing just adds to the time and complexity and makes the project that much more unrealistic.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We finally figured out a bedtime routine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the kids were late to school every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We figured out how to sit down every night for dinner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But we were spending too much on groceries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a reality we all face: no matter what you do, &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/">some other problem comes up to wreck everything&lt;/a>. And the same was true for my project that was dedicated to improving the quality of our software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we started, we focused mainly on making sure there was no problem with how an order was created, the receipt was printed, and the financials were calculated. We had prioritized this correctly; getting these three things right is critical to our success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once we had ramped up our solution, we saw a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of problems that we were able to catch before shipping our latest releases to anyone. We saved ourselves and our customers a lot of headaches that our competitors and their customers were likely suffering through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But over time, those problems decreased and the system seems to now have an immunity to these types of issues. It&amp;rsquo;s not a phenomenon I totally understand, but is one I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of from others in the industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our newfound immunity also hadn&amp;rsquo;t made us immune to &lt;em>every&lt;/em> problem. The problems we &lt;em>weren&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> focused on were still there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hadn&amp;rsquo;t focused on how software is installed at the site and that the correct environment was set up. So the software could be rock solid, but if the environment is off, we&amp;rsquo;re in trouble. It will likely never end, but it&amp;rsquo;s a fun journey to iteratively create immunity through automation in the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My advice with problem solving is &lt;strong>create a system that makes you immune to having the problem again.&lt;/strong> So get a month ahead of income so you never overdraft. Or put all your bills on autopay so you never miss one. Or every Friday take your spouse out for dinner. &lt;strong>But don&amp;rsquo;t expect all problems to go away entirely.&lt;/strong> Keep working at it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll grow beyond where you imagined, solving problems you didn&amp;rsquo;t even think you were capable of taking on. It&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful journey.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ten Takeaways from the Last 10 Years at Radiant/NCR</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2014 08:00:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, thank you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was where I had found myself in the spring of 2004. For some reason, I thought it was a great idea to accept a developer position at a Law Firm that specialized in foreclosures. In some cosmic twist, they sat me in the cubicle next to the lady who was delivering the bad news to people. All day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to get out of there. But to where? A recruiter had told me about this place that was a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_Systems">&lt;em>real&lt;/em> software company&lt;/a> that created a POS for restaurants called Aloha. I was done being the IT department. I wanted to be a part of a &lt;em>real&lt;/em> software company. So on July 12, 2004, ten years from tomorrow, I started working at Radiant Systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I arrived ten years ago a mid-level software engineer whose confidence was shaken by all the foreclosures I had to hear about, and a rough few years of post-Y2K job market crappiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking back, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown so much. Here are ten takeaways from the last ten years at Radiant/NCR:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Speak Up.&lt;/strong> Early on I developed an opinion on what needed to change about my team&amp;rsquo;s situation, and I spoke up and did something about it. This fueled even more change, and gave me a reputation for leadership, which opened up so many opportunities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make a List.&lt;/strong> When I started, I worked with a friend that always made lists, and I thought that was strange at first. But then I realized my colleague always got stuff done quicker than me. So I made a list, and got stuff done as well. People aren&amp;rsquo;t organized because they are dorks that like inane details; they&amp;rsquo;re organized because it works.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do it Right, But Do it Fast.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;ve been passionate about doing things well for a long time. But I realized early on that the only way to do this is to get fast at developing software. I needed to take advantage of tools that I had available to me and get smart about getting things done, so I could have time to get it right.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tools Matter.&lt;/strong> I don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a super-genius to be effective. Really I just need to use the right tools, and let my teams and company for that matter use those tools to be more effective. That way I win, everyone wins, and we can be more focused on the problem at hand. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love tools. It&amp;rsquo;s a win for everyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t be Religious about Process.&lt;/strong> Early on I was very religious about being agile, doing test-driven development, whatever. I&amp;rsquo;ve realized over the years that it&amp;rsquo;s much more valuable to use those frameworks as starting points to solve the problem in front of you. If you solve problems, you get things done, and create a profit for your company. It seems so elementary that one should make more money for one&amp;rsquo;s company than they cost, but the honest truth is the degree to which you do that is the degree to which you will have flexibility on everything else: money, what you work on, flexibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Be Patient.&lt;/strong> I can think over the past ten years of so many times where things weren&amp;rsquo;t going well, or where I wanted something to change so badly. Eventually it did. Like I say above, if you create value, that value is rewarded. So focus on the value, not on the drama or the desire to change everything overnight.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You Live with the Past Forever, so get the Present Right.&lt;/strong> I am at a conference in Huntington Beach this week and was at breakfast overhearing two of our users argue about the proper approach to a weakness in a product…that I created seven years ago. It was a strange feeling that I had so much impact on these people so many years later. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the years, is that you have to live with the past for a long time, especially when you move projects and can&amp;rsquo;t influence the product directly, so get it right today because you never know what tomorrow will bring.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Value is Immune to Change.&lt;/strong> In the last ten years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been through the worst recession ever, an acquisition from Radiant to NCR, and numerous other business cycle downturns and upswings. In every one of those, I&amp;rsquo;ve thrived. Why? Because I&amp;rsquo;ve focused on bringing value to my employer beyond what they pay me. If one is valuable, change doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Even if the company folds, that value can be transferred elsewhere. So I don&amp;rsquo;t worry about change; I worry about value.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without Sales, Software is Dead.&lt;/strong> There is a sales guy at this conference who is the center of attention. He&amp;rsquo;s laughing, drinking, yucking it up with the customers. And they love it. For years, the software engineer in me despised it. &amp;ldquo;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the first thing about software&amp;rdquo; I would tell myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned recently though that without sales and marketing, software is only an idea that dies quickly. Software &lt;em>needs&lt;/em> to be sold, and that usually happens by people who actually had friends in High School. Sales is a valuable aspect of software and must be rewarded.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Show Grattitude.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;ve had  my share of ups and downs in the past ten years. But when I look back, these ten years have completely changed my life. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have gotten there without John Pearson, Vince Severns, Jeff Hughes, Jimmy Fortuna, and Honza Fedak helping me through, and the numerous team members and other leaders who have believed in me. I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way since I was grimacing next to the lady explaining the foreclosure to the poor soul on the other line. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very open with people about how great this journey has been for me.&lt;/li>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The room was standing room only. I was playing &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1tj2zJ2Wvg">Welcome to the Jungle&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; as loud as my company-issued laptop would play. There was a considerable buzz in the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/speaking/">speaking at a conference session&lt;/a> entitled &amp;ldquo;The New Diagnostic Utility.&amp;rdquo; This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Get Rich Quick with Flipping Real Estate conference session. This was The Diagnostic Utility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What was so jarring about this experience was the lackluster response I had gotten to this tool up until this point. The idea came &lt;a href="www.linkedin.com/in/nicolemillspmp">from a colleague&lt;/a> that dealt with diagnosing environmental issues in sites. She and her team were excited about it. I understood the need. But no one else seemed to be enthused. Why not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conference I was at was full of people who install our software at restaurants all over North America. They had issues that needed to be diagnosed. The title &amp;ldquo;The Diagnostic Utility&amp;rdquo; was translated to them like &amp;ldquo;Save Yourself Hours of Time Making Sure You Did Everything Right&amp;rdquo;. This was the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/">safety net&lt;/a> they needed. Their attendance and enthusiasm confirmed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is probably the most valuable lesson I&amp;rsquo;ve learned this year: &lt;strong>a solution is only effective when it is &lt;em>in the hands&lt;/em> of the one that has a problem.&lt;/strong> Not the one that &lt;em>knows&lt;/em> about the problem. Not even the one who is &lt;em>losing money&lt;/em> on the problem. &lt;strong>The one who has the problem.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when your kid doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to get to school on time, the solution is waking up earlier, but it&amp;rsquo;s only effective when your kid &lt;em>wants&lt;/em> to be on time to school to avoid a consequence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a project is proposed but the people who own that process don&amp;rsquo;t believe there&amp;rsquo;s a problem, you don&amp;rsquo;t do the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you&amp;rsquo;re getting frustrated that a customer isn&amp;rsquo;t responsive enough to your solution, perhaps they don&amp;rsquo;t see there is a problem and perhaps you need to find another customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was the case for The New Diagnostic Utility. Once I found the right audience, everything fell into place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Measure for Reality</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2014 08:10:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>Buffalo Ribeye, medium at &lt;a href="http://www.reata.net/fort-worth-restaurant.html">Reata&lt;/a> with a glass of cab. That&amp;rsquo;s what I get when I&amp;rsquo;m ready to celebrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had finally sold our house and knew we needed to jump on the next one. On the first day of looking, we found a house with a lot of potential and decided we wanted to make an offer. When the offer was accepted, we got babysitting for the kids and headed to Reata to celebrate. Then I got a text. Look away, look away! Another one. My wife is more important than this phone. Another one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A friend of mine wanted me to come work with him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The offer was very attractive and tempting. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t take it for a number of reasons, one of which was that I felt like my work wasn&amp;rsquo;t finished at my current job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then the next two weeks were hell at work. Negativity. Failure. Struggle. Wondering to myself if there will every be anything but negativity, failure, and struggle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was fed up and needed to get honest with myself, so I went to &lt;a href="http://www.esparzastexas.com/home">Esparzas&lt;/a> and mapped out how I could get out of the situation I was in over a few margaritas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me let you in on a little secret of mine: every three months, I go to a restaurant, have at least two margaritas, and write out what I&amp;rsquo;m happy about, what I&amp;rsquo;m not happy about, and what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do about it. This particular day I was not happy about the fact that I turned down a great offer and didn&amp;rsquo;t have a wildly successful project at the time that made that decision feel worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem I uncovered that day over a few margaritas was that &lt;strong>we were doing some great things but those great things weren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>measured&lt;/em> and &lt;em>reported on&lt;/em>.&lt;/strong> So to outsiders, especially senior management, those great things didn&amp;rsquo;t exist. What I needed to do was measure the outcomes we were creating, and then share those measurements with the stakeholders on the project. That would turn &amp;ldquo;is this ever going to work?&amp;rdquo; into &amp;ldquo;this is working but they have a few issues right now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a few months, we created a daily report that showed the project&amp;rsquo;s output &lt;em>every day&lt;/em> for the runs that happened &lt;em>every day&lt;/em>. This was a game changer for my project, and for my job. Now I look for any way to measure what outcomes I&amp;rsquo;m creating because I know no matter how good the outcome is, if it isn&amp;rsquo;t measured, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To wrap up the story, I made the right decision with staying with my company. The project just needed some advertised regular measurement. Once that was in place everything changed. And my friend left that job six months after he made that offer, due to strife. A year after that the project he was on was cancelled.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Embrace Difficulty</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/embrace-difficulty/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2014 08:12:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/embrace-difficulty/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-embrace-difficulty.jpg" alt="Embrace Difficulty" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It was an impossible project and I was scared. The fact that &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">the world was ending&lt;/a> was the least of my concerns. We have software that is so flexible and configurable that it was impossible to fully test all the combinations of options our customers could run. My leadership at the time asked us to mitigate this by recording everything that happened at a restaurant and playing it back it back internally on prereleased software to make sure everything behaved the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t overstate how I felt: this problem scared the crap out of me. So much could go wrong, and so many issues to figure out. How would I get the software started? How would I know when/if the simulation was running correctly? What about all the other automation projects I had heard about over the years that had been cancelled due to lack of results? Would this project (and my career with it) be the next one thrown on the scrap heap when management realizes how impossible it is?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to step back, step away from my fear, and think of a good strategy. We were facing a difficult problem. The process we would come up with was likely to fail. A lot. Instead of running &lt;em>away&lt;/em> from that failure, we needed to embrace it. We needed to welcome it with open arms. Because &lt;strong>if we didn&amp;rsquo;t face the failure head on, we would never get past it, and we would fail.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we created a system where we ran any automation we had &lt;em>every day&lt;/em>. In fact, this is how we do it today, with over 150 restaurants running in a virtual environment and over 4,000 small scenarios. We do it every night. Do we have to do it every night? Technically no. But we embrace the difficulty of it by doing it every night so we get quick feedback of the problems and keep it on track.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People still argue with me over whether we &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to run this every night. I&amp;rsquo;m fine with that; I know it seems silly at times. But I think it&amp;rsquo;s key to our success: &lt;strong>we embrace the difficulty by doing difficult things all the time, so we can learn how to deal with them and make them not difficult anymore.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few other examples of embracing the difficulty in a system:&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Blogging&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Keeping a month ahead and posting at a regular pace&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Learning to Cook&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Cooking a regular meal on a day of a week&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Keeping the Family Close&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Eating dinner together every night&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This year our family has been &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/lowering-expenses-with-contentment/">focused on contentment&lt;/a> over consumerism. It all started with realizing that our children believed the lie that stuff was going to make them happy. Where on earth would they learn that behavior? It was probably from that school they went to. No, as we looked further they learned it from us, because we were living that way as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we started focusing on contentment, we realized it was a part of our whole lives. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t about just saving money on groceries and not eating out. Everything we did was a topic of conversation. And thus, the topic of travel went up, and we went through a bit of a transformation on how we see it. As I did in &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/engineering-laundry/">an earlier post&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through what I did and hope you get some ideas about how you can find more contentment in your travel choices.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="inherited-system">Inherited System&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The system we had gone with was similar to what most people in suburban middle-class America do:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We drove wherever we wanted.&lt;/strong> If we needed to go to the store, we drove. If we needed to go to Maryland, we drove. There was never a question &lt;em>if&lt;/em> we should be using a car. We drove.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Travel was a fixed expense.&lt;/strong> Travel expenses (gas, repairs, insurance) to us were almost the same as our mortgage payment. We just accepted the amount and moved on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fuel Economy was a medium priority.&lt;/strong> When we shopped for cars, we took fuel economy into consideration, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t make it a priority. We had two cars that would fit our entire family in them, but of course we didn&amp;rsquo;t need that.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We did have parts of our system that were a bit different than the norm:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We live and work locally.&lt;/strong> We are less than a ten minute drive from my work, our church, the kid&amp;rsquo;s schools, and grocery shopping. This was a huge priority to us when we moved a couple of years ago.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We drive used, paid off cars.&lt;/strong> We&amp;rsquo;re OK with the car not being a status symbol. We&amp;rsquo;ve always driven non-luxury, used cars.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>These last two elements are critical components for the new system outlined below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="problems-with-the-system">Problems with the System&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When we started looking at our lives and budget holistically, we saw a few problems with the system we had been living by:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We had a sedentary lifestyle that was setting us up for health problems.&lt;/strong> I had a desk job. Anytime we wanted to go &lt;em>anywhere&lt;/em> we went and sat on a metal-encased couch that launched us down a paved road. I was gaining a few pounds every few years. I went to the gym sometimes, but it was hard to fit it into my busy schedule.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We had a consumptive mindset.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/" title="Achievable Contentment">a key to contentment&lt;/a> must be to think of yourself as a producer instead of a consumer. If you feel &lt;em>entitled&lt;/em> to consume, then nothing is ever good enough. When I produce as much as possible, the times when I do consume are wonderful, gracious experiences. Our system made us 100% consumers of our transportation, via the car.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h1 id="new-system">New System&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Our new system makes us producers as much as possible and leads us to a healthy lifestyle:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We walk or bike within five miles of our home.&lt;/strong> We don&amp;rsquo;t allow ourselves to get in a car if we need to go down to the grocery store; we bike. And, a magical thing happens: we get exercise! &lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s such a transformation when fitness becomes a part of your life rather than a scheduled activity.&lt;/strong> What about the kids? They bike too! We have to focus on safety the whole time, but we do and they make it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We consciously use the car&lt;/strong>. When we are going to use the car to go somewhere &lt;em>more&lt;/em> than five miles away, we ask ourselves, &amp;ldquo;do I need anything else?&amp;rdquo; We try to consolidate trips because &lt;em>getting in the car is a special activity&lt;/em>. If I&amp;rsquo;m going to launch a couch down a paved road, I better have some good reasons for doing so.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I periodically work from home.&lt;/strong> A day or two a week, I work from home. We&amp;rsquo;re creating an office for me, but for now I work at the kitchen table, or if the kids are there, I ride my bike down to the library. This helps me get focus to think about things, but it also keeps everything local and manageable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>I bike or ride a scooter to work.&lt;/strong> I haven&amp;rsquo;t purchased a scooter yet, but I will. I have been biking to work 80% of the days I work there.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We have one car.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;m selling my Camry and we&amp;rsquo;ll only have a Sienna minivan. We really only need to take the family around in one car, so why do we need two? We don&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I absolutely love this new system. It has to be wrapped up in a mindset that convenience and comfort aren&amp;rsquo;t the most important things in life. This is definitely a more inconvenient and uncomfortable system. But those weren&amp;rsquo;t our goals; contentment and production were our goals. Living and working locally and minimizing our use of the automobile has left us more contented and productive than ever!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Increase Income by Negotiating</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/increase-income-by-negotiating/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2014 08:00:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/increase-income-by-negotiating/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When one &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/move-the-needle-with-dave-ramsey/">gets serious&lt;/a> about meeting their financial goals, the obvious immediate focus is &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/lowering-expenses-with-contentment/">to lower expenses&lt;/a>. If you want to get out of debt, stop going to Starbucks. And find a way to be content with not having it anymore. But there is another side of the equation as well: your income.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back in 2010 when I shifted my personal finance perspective, I decided to get serious about my income as well as my expenses. And I thankfully found the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0931213207/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0931213207&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=hedgeopscom-20&amp;amp;linkId=W6BC6IOM726IEVJK">Negotiating Your Salary: How to Make $1000 a Minute&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="http://www.salarynegotiations.com/">Jack Chapman&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book changed my thinking in three important ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Everything is negotiable.&lt;/strong> Stop looking at things as fixed. They aren&amp;rsquo;t. You need to create more value for your company, and they will be willing to pay you more. Negotiate for the value that you are creating, and by all means &lt;em>work your butt off&lt;/em> to create the value. But don&amp;rsquo;t just passively go through life accepting whatever is given to you. Negotiate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Be intentional.&lt;/strong> Don&amp;rsquo;t let performance reviews happen to you. Be intentional. Be clear about your goals and work with management to accomplish them. Don&amp;rsquo;t just accept what they&amp;rsquo;re telling you, but press in and make sure that they respect you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Stop talking.&lt;/strong> When negotiating, the one who talks is the one who is losing. Be simple about your goals and stop talking. This is the part that I struggle with the most. &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/speaking/">I can&amp;rsquo;t stop talking&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This turned a perceived static situation I had no control over into a dynamic situation where I increased my value to my employer and in return over time increased my income. It takes a while, but if your goals are realistic and if you work hard, you&amp;rsquo;ll get there. I know as a manager I love managing people who are intentional and motivated to work hard to create an outcome. I&amp;rsquo;ll always take that person over an unmotivated lazy person who is fine with their salary.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lowering Expenses with Contentment</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/lowering-expenses-with-contentment/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2014 08:00:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/lowering-expenses-with-contentment/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-lowering-expenses-with-contentment.jpg" alt="Lowering Expenses with Contentment" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/you-need-a-budget/">YNAB&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/move-the-needle-with-dave-ramsey/">Dave Ramsey&lt;/a> entered our lives, we became an unstoppable force to meet our financial goals. Our original debt payoff forecasts were beat by a mile, largely because we got serious and focused all of our time, energy, and money to debt payoff. We had met some really great goals and were feeling great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there was a problem. After we met our debt payoff goal, the angels did not descend from the heavens and make everything better. And there was still an insatiable appetite for more stuff. The only difference was that now I had more money to spend on getting that stuff. It was like we had finished a long diet but did nothing about our love of ice cream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we got more stuff for a few months. And I felt the same. Dave Ramsey has a saying, &amp;ldquo;Live like no one else, so that later you can live like no one else.&amp;rdquo; We had lived like no one else, so that later…we would get depressed about how meaningless it all is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem: you&amp;rsquo;ll never win with discontentment. You never find enough. You&amp;rsquo;re always wanting more. So in the long run, the &amp;ldquo;sacrifice now&amp;rdquo; will not lead to peace and balance later, because you&amp;rsquo;re training yourself for discontentment. Let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate this in other areas of life:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>With&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Live like no one else looks like&lt;/th>
&lt;th>But contenment looks like&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Dieting&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to join crossfit and do that multiple times a week, and eat Paleo and judge everyone else who doesn&amp;rsquo;t as idiots&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to learn how to enjoy the calories I really need, appreciating that I&amp;rsquo;m swimming in a sea of cheap calories that kings of old didn&amp;rsquo;t have&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Work&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to make this happen and work Saturdays and drive everyone to do the same…this is going to launch my career into the stratosphere&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to really think about what and how I&amp;rsquo;m doing things, and make sure I do the right things with the right team, and do those things well&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Marriage&lt;/td>
&lt;td>We&amp;rsquo;re going to go to counseling, a marriage retreat, and then sit down every night and talk&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to give her a break and serve her and &lt;a title="Releasing Control" href="http://hedge-ops.com/releasing-control/">try to not control her&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Money&lt;/td>
&lt;td>If I get an extra job, I can pay off my debt and get an expensive car ten years from now&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I don&amp;rsquo;t need an expensive car. Or all this stuff. I&amp;rsquo;ll stop buying stuff and find that I have a lot of money left over that I can save. And wow, I&amp;rsquo;m happier!&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Sometimes the middle column is called for. But only temporarily, because discontentment leads to discontentment. It&amp;rsquo;s a neverending cycle. And the only way to get to where you want to go is through contentment. You may need to spend a few months moving the needle. Great. The focus though should be on finding contentment in your life, and creating a margin of time, money, and focus that will help you accomplish your goals long-term.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Move the Needle with Dave Ramsey</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/move-the-needle-with-dave-ramsey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 08:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/move-the-needle-with-dave-ramsey/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>We had &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/">a failure that was the catalyst to change&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/you-need-a-budget/">a tool that would help us change our relationship with money&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Full disclosure: our household has kind of moved away from some of Dave Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s ideas since 2010 when we drank the Koolaid. I&amp;rsquo;ll get into why in the next post, but for now I want to write what I appreciate about him and how he presented personal finance to us in a way that got us serious about getting out of debt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dave Ramsey doesn&amp;rsquo;t do debt. He hates it. To him, the only reason one should get into debt is to buy a house, and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even fully recommend that one. Most people think he&amp;rsquo;s extreme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s genius is that when it comes to being in debt, being extreme is exactly what is called for. The numbers aren&amp;rsquo;t the reason people aren&amp;rsquo;t getting out of debt; the psychology is. So when you get out debt the Dave Ramsey way, you sell everything. You don&amp;rsquo;t eat out. You think about it every day. You work extra. Maybe an extra job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You get sick and tired of being sick and tired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The principle here is &lt;em>Move the Needle&lt;/em>. Sometimes it makes sense to get crazy and move the needle in some area of your life. Make a change happen, possibly at the short-term sacrifice of other things, so you don&amp;rsquo;t quit. Once you accomplish something, quitting it is no longer an option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you&amp;rsquo;re needing to make a change and gut it out in the short term in order to create the environment where you can win in the long, term, have at it! I know with getting out of debt, this is the only way to go in order to actually do it. If you try to nickel and dime your way out of debt, you&amp;rsquo;ll never get there because you&amp;rsquo;ll get distracted and go after something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we got serious and decided to move the needle with getting out of debt, all the pieces fell into place and we got out of debt really quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is when this becomes a way of life. At some point, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to stop moving the needle. More on this in the next post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Month Ahead</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/month-ahead/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2014 08:00:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/month-ahead/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;re at the mall, it&amp;rsquo;s the 12th of the month and you want to buy sunglasses. Do you have the money? If you&amp;rsquo;re living paycheck to paycheck, it depends on whether the mortgage will come before or after your paycheck. It might also depend on your checking account balance. This is normal for most Americans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is also insanity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best thing &lt;a href="http://ynab.refr.cc/C9FV2R2">YNAB&lt;/a> did for us is encourage us to get a month ahead in income (they call this &lt;a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/method/rule-four">Rule Four&lt;/a>). Paychecks we receive in June pay July&amp;rsquo;s expenses. But for most stuck in the paycheck to paycheck rat race, the idea itself seems like a fantasy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were there, definitely, but we got obsessed with getting a month ahead because we wanted to experience its benefits of simplicity, peace, and clarity. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we did it:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We Took Advantage of Bi-Annual Three Paycheck Months.&lt;/strong> Luckily, January 2010 was a three paycheck month. We budgeted every month for two paychecks, so we were already halfway to our goal the very first month. If you&amp;rsquo;re paid biweekly, every six months is a golden opportunity to get ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We Drew a Line in the Sand.&lt;/strong> Before we started using YNAB, &lt;a href="http://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/" title="Failure the Catalyst">we had used our credit card&lt;/a> and were in the process of paying it off. Normally that would have been our top priority, but instead of working on that, we made those off budget accounts and set them to the side and paid the minimum. This rerouted some cash that was planned on paying off a credit card balance to being a month ahead. This is how I recommend approaching YNAB:** what&amp;rsquo;s in the past is in the past; focus on creating a system that will work for your future and everything will fall into place.**&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>All Margin Went to Rule Four.&lt;/strong> We had a few hundred dollars a month that we had extra every month. Sometimes it would go to something fun or to meet one of our goals. When we implemented YNAB, &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of our money went toward this one goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Moved End of Month Bills to the Next Month.&lt;/strong> We paid our car insurance every month. I called the insurance company and had them move the bill to be due from the 28th to the 2nd of the next month. To them it&amp;rsquo;s a few days. But in YNAB, it gets you out of the current month and into the next month…and closer to being a month ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Planned for a Lean First Month.&lt;/strong> We put everything into getting a month ahead, so it was OK if we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the &lt;em>full&lt;/em> set of monthly income for our first Rule Four month. We just needed to cover the necessities, and let a month pass. At that point we would be a &lt;em>full&lt;/em> month ahead on income. This is the time to have one of those &amp;ldquo;I won&amp;rsquo;t buy anything&amp;rdquo; months!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>When we were close, we cautiously overrode Rule Three.&lt;/strong> Over the years I have really grown to appreciate the wisdom of &lt;a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/method/rule-three">Rule Three&lt;/a>: every month start over and budget the money you have available. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about making every month perfectly balance. When you override Rule Three by carrying a negative category balance, you run the risk of having to focus on your account balances and you lose many of the benefits of the YNAB system. When we were just getting started, and within hundreds of dollars of being able to make it through February on January&amp;rsquo;s income. We had to prepay our portion of a family vacation that would happen in the summer. Rather than wait another month or two to meet our goal, we had that category carry over a negative balance for the next month. We had done the steps before so there was no risk that our balances would get too low.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;re a month ahead, if we&amp;rsquo;re at the mall and we want to buy something, we check the category balance. We don&amp;rsquo;t care about when the mortgage payment will go through, when I get paid, or the checking account balance. All of those variables have been removed because we are spending last month&amp;rsquo;s money this month. Now that we have clarity on just focusing on the category balance, we put our energy into making better decisions. And that for us has made all the difference in helping us go wherever we want to go financially.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You Need a Budget</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/you-need-a-budget/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2014 07:45:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/you-need-a-budget/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-you-need-a-budget.jpg" alt="You Need a Budget" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I experienced &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/">a financial tailspin&lt;/a> that got my attention enough to make some serious changes in my life. I needed to assemble a team that could help me meet my goals. &lt;a href="http://www.theprayerroomdfw.com/index.cfm?i=11234&amp;amp;mid=25&amp;amp;blogid=4177">A friend of mine&lt;/a> had told me about budgeting software that he had loved that fit with how I liked to budget. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken &lt;a href="http://ynab.refr.cc/C9FV2R2">You Need a Budget&lt;/a> (YNAB, pronounced why-nab) seriously until then, but now was the time to dive deeper into this tool to see if it would fit my needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I found was a great software tool created by a team that cared more about serving people and changing lives than making money. This is a critical piece of being on my team: you must be more dedicated to serving others than to enriching yourself. And the small team that created YNAB was dedicated to service over self. This software has changed my life in so many ways; I feel indebted to them to do whatever I can to make them successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what is so good about this software? A lot, but I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on four aspects:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Simple Enough for Non-Geeks.&lt;/strong> This was a requirement for me. I needed my wife to be involved and she isn&amp;rsquo;t a math nerd or a geek. YNAB presents budgeting in such a simple way that non-geeks, non financially saavy people can understand it with &lt;a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com/support/training-and-education">minimal training&lt;/a> and make it happen. My wife&amp;rsquo;s involvement in our goals has been critical to our success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Focus is on the Right Goals.&lt;/strong> In other budgeting programs, you&amp;rsquo;re focused on account balances or fitting your life in the system. YNAB has great systems for keeping you focused on where you want your money to go, and forgetting about the timing of bills or keeping everything balanced perfectly. So now we think about what our goal is and how to meet that goal, month to month. And then we forget about it and live our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s Reality Focused.&lt;/strong> I was helping a friend set up YNAB, and he said to me, &amp;ldquo;I want to wait until next month to start this so I can buy a couple of iPhones.&amp;rdquo; I informed him that buying iPhones was as simple as allocating hundreds of dollars into a category and then spending it. YNAB doesn&amp;rsquo;t force you into a perfect situation or month. Those don&amp;rsquo;t exist! You simply tell it what you want to do with your money. That can even include blowing a lot of money on electronics; it&amp;rsquo;s up to you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It Plans for the Unexpected.&lt;/strong> it&amp;rsquo;s not expecting you to perfectly plan every cent and then rush to the software whenever something changes. It lets you easily change your plan, or just wait for the next month, where the available money will be adjusted to how well or bad you did the month before. A solid system must plan for noncompliance to the plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Four and a half years later, YNAB is helping us meet our goals just as it did in the beginning. It is our constant companion through life, always helping us bring together our intentions and our actions. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something to help you meet your financial goals, you owe it to yourself to look at &lt;a href="http://ynab.refr.cc/C9FV2R2">YNAB&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Failure the Catalyst</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2014 08:00:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t take credit cards, only cash.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was November 2009, and I was locked into &amp;ldquo;Project: Have a Third Child&amp;rdquo;. Part of the deal I made with my wife is that we could offset some of the hardships of having another child by doing some things for ourselves. This translated partly into changing our half bath into a full bath and completely redoing the furniture and decorating of our master bedroom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with most home projects, reality quickly surpassed our budget. That was OK. I was going to use my credit card. Nevermind that I promised myself I would never use it in this manner…this totally frivolous remodeling project was an emergency! I would pay it off, I promised. I just needed to get through this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.viperplumbing.com/">My plumber&lt;/a> dug a hole in our foundation, extended the toilet drain to what would be the shower, and charged me a hefty sum to do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And he only took cash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As did &lt;a href="http://mastertilesetter.com/">the tile guys&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://paulhedgpethpainting.blogspot.com/">the painter&lt;/a>. Crap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The inevitable occurred. I overdrafted our checking account and our finances went into a tailspin that took us a few weeks to get out of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My wife and I awoke to how totally out of control and useless our current financial system had been. Some major changes were on the horizon. But these changes had a beginning in failure. At the time failure seems so terrible, so awful, that nothing good can come out of it. But in reality failure is often a catalyst for change.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>When you fail by&lt;/th>
&lt;th>it is the catalyst for&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>losing your job&lt;/td>
&lt;td>putting yourself on the right path to meet your goals, with the options wide open&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>a marital separation or affair&lt;/td>
&lt;td>finding or abandoning your true commitment to that person, which means there will no longer be a lukewarm relationship&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>a project failure at work&lt;/td>
&lt;td>understanding what &lt;i>will not &lt;/i>work, so you can pursue what will work either for you or your organization&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>gaining weight&lt;/td>
&lt;td>reanalyzing your relationship with food and an active lifestyle and making changes&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Failure feels terrible at the moment, but it really is a wonderful blessing because it is the only catalyst I know of for real success. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet been able to believe this enough to make failure suck any less, but it sure is nice to know while I&amp;rsquo;m going through it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Engineering Laundry</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/engineering-laundry/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2014 08:00:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/engineering-laundry/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-engineering-laundry.jpg" alt="Engineering Laundry" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Before two weeks ago, &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">my wife&lt;/a> had an intense hatred she only shared with close friends. This was something she avoided; she abhorred. Something that trapped her in a life of anger and despair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clothes. Worn and discarded. Washed. Dried. Put away. Repeat. Until death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of weeks ago, she asked me to reduce her workload by doing laundry. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thrilled but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t argue against helping her out with a job that I could do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I got to thinking about it, here&amp;rsquo;s what really intrigued me: laundry is a simple system that can be optimized, or engineered, for maximum efficiencies. As an engineer, I really love maximizing efficiencies. So I decided to tackle this problem of laundry using principles I&amp;rsquo;ve learned as an engineer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="inherited-system">Inherited &lt;strong>System&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The system I inherited went something like this, for our family of five:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Each room on the second floor has a clothes hamper (all of our sleeping rooms are on the second floor). When cleaning the room, put the clothes in the clothes hamper.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re on the first floor, put the clothes in the laundry room which is on the first floor.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once a week, on no particular day, take all the clothes from the rooms and pile it in the laundry room.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sort the clothes into loads of whites, colors, towels.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wash and dry the clothes (this takes two days).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the clothes are dried, put the clothes that are to be hung up flat on top of the dryer. Put the clothes that are in dressers in a bag that hangs on the wall, one for each person. There is also a bag for kitchen towels and bathroom towels.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At some point take all bags upstairs, and put the clothes away in dressers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At some point hang up the clothes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This entire process would begin as it was ending. In other words, laundry ended up being a neverending mess of never-done-ness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problems-with-the-system">Problems &lt;strong>with the System&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I looked at the system not as a household chore but as a system that I could maximize using principles I use at work. So looking at it that way, what were the problems with this system?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Excessive Batching.&lt;/strong> Everything was piled up and done at once, and there was no flow. When there is so much work in progress, you can&amp;rsquo;t optimize the system because there are too many variables in it. It&amp;rsquo;s like trying to cook Thanksgiving Dinner…all at once. There has to be a clear process in place and simplicity at every step for any hope of true optimization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Excessive Sorting.&lt;/strong> Laundry was sorted at least two times within a large set. There was a separation of &lt;em>all the laundry&lt;/em> into loads, and another separation of &lt;em>all the laundry&lt;/em> by who owned the laundry. This was especially difficult with the kids, whose sizes are remarkably similar and ever-changing, even though they insist it&amp;rsquo;s totally obvious that the shirt belongs to one or the other.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lack of Ownership.&lt;/strong> My wife was doing all the work. None of us wanted to do the job. So we were leaving valuable contributions from me and my sons on the table, which led to…&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Despair from Lack of Closure.&lt;/strong> The system didn&amp;rsquo;t give you a sense of being &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo;. In software terms there was no &amp;ldquo;release&amp;rdquo;. It was just always going.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="new-system">New System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I did some internet searching and &lt;a href="http://lifeasmom.com/2013/04/kids-can-do-laundry.html">came across an article&lt;/a> that was extremely close to what I have implemented. It addresses all of the problems stated above. Here&amp;rsquo;s the system:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Every person in the house gets their own laundry basket except for parents who share theirs. Every person is responsible for putting their own clothes into &lt;em>only&lt;/em> their own basket.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a basket downstairs that towels and linens go into.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Every basket is done by its owner on a particular day of the week. Someone helps too if that&amp;rsquo;s needed. Our schedule is:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Day&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Basket&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Owner&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Helper&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Monday&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Parents&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Mom&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Dad&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Tuesday&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Oldest&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Oldest&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Dad&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Wednesday&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Towels&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Dad&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Mom&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Thursday&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Middle Child&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Middle Child&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Dad&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Friday&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Youngest Child&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Dad&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Dad&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-the-new-system">Benefits of the New System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve done this system for a week now, and wow has it made a difference. Here&amp;rsquo;s why:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ve broken the whole system down into smaller, manageable chunks. That way there is a sense of progress, completion, and lack of despair. Since the laundry room is clean (other than a basket with towels), it is a place where you can create an outcome relatively quickly and get out. You&amp;rsquo;re done. There&amp;rsquo;s not a big scary laundry monster in there to kill you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sorting has been drastically minimized. Now when we wash the youngest child&amp;rsquo;s clothes, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely clear whose clothes those are when they come out of the dryer. This knocks off the total time we spend on it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone owns laundry. It&amp;rsquo;s not something that only Mom does. And she gets to do the part that is most important to her (her own clothes), so we win by me not accidentally shrinking her brand new sweater.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The problem that one might have with this system is that you are doing laundry &lt;em>every day&lt;/em>. But a different person is in charge of it, and it&amp;rsquo;s a mangable amount. It seems to be working out well for us so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The great thing I found through this process is how well management principles relate to so many other areas of life. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the things I want to explore in the future: taking wisdom from one area of life and applying it elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Do these principles apply to another area of your life?&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Surprise</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/surprise/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2014 08:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/surprise/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/the-grand-vision/">the last post&lt;/a> I wrote about a mistake I made where I focused too much on The Grand Vision and not enough on solving small problems. At the time, I felt that accomplishing The Grand Vision was going to be awesome and would save the world, and would mean that there would be a parade for my entire team, and cheering, and wonderful speeches given for us all. It will be glorious, except, now I realize I totally screwed it up:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I left no room for surprise.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Surprise is when someone&amp;rsquo;s expectation is suddenly shifted into a totally new place in an instant. &lt;strong>Surprise has a way of changing the game immediately and causing your competitors to scramble.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When your competition expects an outcome, they have time to spin it as no big deal. Your flaws (and there will be flaws if you ship it) will be the surprises, not the big game-changing outcome that you created. People adjust to the &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; reality over a period of months, when in fact the reality hasn&amp;rsquo;t even changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lesson will be central to everything I do for the rest of my life. If I am trying to create an important outcome that makes a difference, I should focus &lt;em>first&lt;/em> on creating the outcome. &lt;strong>If it is as important as I think it is, surprise will be my ally.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Grand Vision</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-grand-vision/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2014 08:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-grand-vision/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Late last year I started a new project that was dedicated to improving our delivery process and tools. I spent a few weeks talking to people throughout our organization about what the problems were and how we can best address them. And then I came up with &lt;strong>The Grand Vision.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Grand Vision was an awesome elevator speech where I drew quadrants and arrows, talked about the main problems I was seeing and how to bring them together into one, totally awesome, unified structure that Would Save The World.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one of the meetings, a key leader I respect said to me, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s ambitious.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Thanks,&amp;rdquo; I replied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complement&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lesson I learned is that it&amp;rsquo;s important to map out the process and see how what you&amp;rsquo;re doing fits into the entire goal. &lt;em>But it&amp;rsquo;s also important to solve problems immediately that have a quick return on investment.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This kind of thinking happens all the time:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to avoid the really tough problems in front of you by dreaming a big dream.&lt;/strong> I think many of us like to think if we can&amp;rsquo;t do it all, then why do it at all? The real battle is won when we drop that all or nothing thinking and get something done&amp;hellip;&lt;strong>today&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When have you let the grand vision distract you from what really needed to be done right then and there?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Safety Net</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2014 08:00:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Late last year I began seriously working on improving how we deliver updates to our software to restaurants. One of the most interesting parts about my job is how many aspects of technology become incredibly difficult when you have a chef twenty feet away instead of a data center technician in a lab coat. Updates are no exception: the operation of the restaurant itself is at stake and we must get it right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how do you improve something like that? Believe me, this was something that was keeping me up at night. The problem is the huge amount of risk involved in anything going wrong in the restaurant operations, but at the same time the huge operational benefit improving it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The insight we found was that &lt;em>before making a change that has risk, build a safety net to ensure that the change will have the desired effect&lt;/em>. &lt;strong>Build quality into the system, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make the needed changes to the system.&lt;/strong> Otherwise, you&amp;rsquo;re dead when the first problem hits and you&amp;rsquo;ll never recover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This insight relates to so many areas of life and business:&lt;/p>

&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A safety net is a critical aspect of any system I create today. The bigger the risk involved, the more I strive to include saftey in the solution we create.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Every year we sit down and create a specific set of goals for my projects. The &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/">goals are always aggressive&lt;/a>, and every year we wonder to ourselves how we are going to do it. Most years we spend the first few months trying to come up with a strategy for even making the goals possible. This is by no means an easy endeavor. And &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">achieving the goals&lt;/a> on this list is extremely important to me. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell the whole story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is not on the list is just as important to my future as what is on the list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the past five years &amp;ldquo;Getting a team set up on &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity&lt;/a> has never been an explicit goal. Neither has &amp;ldquo;introduce and administrate &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/">YouTrack&lt;/a> to increase the maturity and efficiencies of teams.&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;introduce &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/">git&lt;/a> as a superior version control alternative to TFS and Subversion&amp;rdquo;. But to me, these things that don&amp;rsquo;t make the list are major contributors to my success because they foster an attitude of generosity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t believe success happens without generosity. Plans never explicitly state &amp;ldquo;be generous to others and solve problems.&amp;rdquo; But those who follow this path end up being lifted up by those whom they served, being served in return. I think this is a secret to my success: &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">serve others generously&lt;/a>, which builds a community of generosity of which I am also a recipient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast, the one who is stingy and focuses only on that which will advance one&amp;rsquo;s own intersts will end up hitting a ceiling of productivity. At some point those around her are alienated, aren&amp;rsquo;t growing enough to contribute at higher levels, or aren&amp;rsquo;t properly engaged in the vision of growth that is required for success to be achieved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a standing invitation for anyone to put thirty minutes on my calendar to get Continuous Integration (TeamCity), issue tracking (YouTrack), or distributed version control (git) set up on their project. Even though it isn&amp;rsquo;t on the list of my explicit goals, it is my pleasure to make the world a better place, and, in turn, it indirectly helps me reach my own goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In what ways has generosity led to success for you?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Releasing Control</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/releasing-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2014 08:00:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/releasing-control/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Thank God we&amp;rsquo;re in marriage counseling so my wife can finally get her crap together.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A thought that most people have when they enter the marriage counselor&amp;rsquo;s office. I came into the office that day of &lt;a href="http://www.drlescarter.com/">Les Carter&lt;/a>, with &lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">my wonderful wife&lt;/a>, ready for some change. I had a list of things. She was this. She was that. Why can&amp;rsquo;t she just…?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we started I heard a similar tone from my wife. She had a similar list, where only the subject had changed. He is this. He is that. Why can&amp;rsquo;t he just…?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;OK, OK,&amp;rdquo; I thought. &amp;ldquo;I can play this game. So the one with the highest score at the end wins. I will &lt;em>definitely&lt;/em> have a higher score at the end of this one, honey, don&amp;rsquo;t you worry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Les wasn&amp;rsquo;t playing that game. Les gave us a nugget of wisdom that is now a mantra for us:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The more you try to control, the less you are in control. The less you try to control, the more you are in control&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Les was touching on a key element of success: &lt;strong>&lt;em>it&amp;rsquo;s not about creating the perfect level of control so you can have everything your way.&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s about serving, helping, and loving others. It&amp;rsquo;s about making others around you successful. Somehow when this happens, you end up having more success and control than ever. But it&amp;rsquo;s never about the control itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can be applied in many ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>When you want&lt;/th>
&lt;th>You must&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>a good marriage&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Chill out and let your spouse have some space&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>To be a good parent&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Give them freedom to be themselves, which does include structure, but also includes having their own personalities and interests&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>A project at work to succeed&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Enable those around you to be the best they can be and believe in them as you let them work&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Financial security&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Accept that there will be ups and downs and you won&amp;rsquo;t know when those will be, so it&amp;rsquo;s best to be a long-term investor who doesn&amp;rsquo;t bail whenever the market is in trouble&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>When has giving up control given you more control in your life?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Failure Masquerading as Success</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/failure-masquerading-as-success/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2014 08:00:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/failure-masquerading-as-success/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the grades I should have had in high school. My parents didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything saved up for college when I turned 18*. By living at home, under my mom&amp;rsquo;s insurance, and getting support from my dad, I was able to end my Junior year of college with a few thousand dollars of student loans and no credit card debt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough. I &lt;em>needed&lt;/em> to have a successful college life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I began believing that there was a real risk that I was going to look back at my college life as a failure. People in college are supposed to experience community, friends, fun, unfettered learning. Living with mommy and having a job was seriously impeding those goals. I had only one year to make things right. So I did what any idiotic 20-year-old would do: I quit my job waiting tables at an upscale restaurant in Dallas, moved into a dorm, and maxed out my student loans and credit cards to make it happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the next fourteen months I had a lot of fun. I hung out with interesting people, was in walking distance to most of my life, and expanded my mind through books and interesting classes. Based on the terms I had set out for myself, the year was a success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest with you: I spent many years paying off the tens of thousands of dollars I borrowed in that fourteen month period. The years of debt repayment that followed brought home an important truth:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>what felt like success for those fourteen months was really failure masquerading as success.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>When success is real it flows to all areas of life, not just on the area that has the focus. It also flows into the future, not just the present.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When financial success turns a healthy, compatible, and loving marriage into a hate-fest, &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s failure masquerading as success.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When success at work turns colleagues from respect and honor to anger and disdain, &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s failure masquerading as success.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When success in marriage creates isolated, ignored children, &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s failure masquerading as success.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When success on my project this quarter leads to years of rework and confusion, &lt;em>that&amp;rsquo;s failure masquerading as success.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I believe success does have tradeoffs. There are &lt;em>failures&lt;/em> that always &lt;em>accompany&lt;/em> success: having dinner with your family might mean someone else who doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to do that will get promoted instead of you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>But I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that a wise definition of success has collateral damage.&lt;/strong> I believe a life of peace and balance is possible. Anything else quickly becomes failure masquerading as success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Has failure ever masqueraded as success in your life?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What they did do though is tell me over and over again how important it was for me to go to college, something I am thankful for to this day&lt;/li>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re doing great here, and you&amp;rsquo;re an asset to what we&amp;rsquo;re doing. We think you have a bright future with us.&amp;rdquo; My boss was obviously happy &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/">with my performance&lt;/a> and was telling me about it in no uncertain terms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s great, and I appreciate it, but when will I get promoted to Software Architect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted more than anything at that point in my career to be a &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/2010/snapshots/1.html">Software Architect&lt;/a>. The title comes with respect, a great salary, and a leadership position within a software development organization. Most people who knew my goal never questioned its efficacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>…But I now see that it was the wrong goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A good goal is one that delivers what it promises: contentment and happiness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contentment I envisioned after getting the promotion very quickly became discontentment wrapped around another, bigger goal. All of the sudden I wanted to be a Senior Software Architect. And then more. And more. This is insanity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a better way: goals that lead to contentment. Some examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>You&amp;rsquo;ll never be content with having&lt;/th>
&lt;th>But you will be content with&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>The next promotion&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Doing work that matters and being fairly rewarded for it&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>A big raise&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Spending less than you make, whatever it is&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>A new luxury car&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A car you can afford&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>The spouse of your dreams&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A marriage based on love, acceptance, and peace&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>In the left column, everything seems so deceptively simple. &amp;ldquo;All I want is a Mercedes.&amp;rdquo; Well, yes, but _what happens when you get the Mercedes? What &lt;strong>then?&lt;/strong> The left side is one in which you never end up at a destination. You are always striving, always anxious, always gunning for the next thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The left column is a series of steps in life that all follow a commonly accepted pattern of &amp;ldquo;going for the next thing&amp;rdquo;, but arriving nowhere important. These goals ultimately lead to misery and despair once one inevitably finds this out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s strange is that no one questions this path to success, even though there are so many examples of burned out, depressed, unhappy people who have followed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A better definition of success is on the right side. These are achievable goals, not in a few years but right now. The goals aren&amp;rsquo;t as measurable, and those around you won&amp;rsquo;t notice them as much as they would a new Mercedes. However, they deliver what they promise: achievable contentment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Success is achievable contentment through goals that have an end to them. The end of a truly success-oriented goal isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>another goal.&lt;/em> It is contentment and peace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are your goals? Where will they lead?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Christmas with Russians</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2014 08:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-christmas-with-russians" alt="Christmas" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It was Christmas 2008, and the world was going to end. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know if there would be an economy or even civilization. And I had two weeks of vacation to end the year. I had an 18 month old who was mostly occupying himself with Christmas toys, and my wife was two months away from having my second child. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to take the vacation, but the policy at the time was &amp;ldquo;use it or lose it&amp;rdquo;, so I took it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could have done anything with those two weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose to set up &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continous Integration&lt;/a> for one of our largest products through &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was something I was passionate about. I had &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026772IS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0026772IS&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=hedgeopscom-20&amp;amp;linkId=RJ6US3SXFLCWDTR5">read the literature&lt;/a> on how transformative Continuous Integration had been to organizations. This product was built twice a day by a homeade tool called bmcon.exe and some batch files. If the build broke, dozens of people stopped everything to try to get it working, with no clear feedback mechanism for knowing what went wrong, who did it, and whether it was being worked on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was my moral duty to fix this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it so happened that those working on TeamCity were going to take their Christmas holiday&amp;hellip;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_Russia">on January 7&lt;/a>. They were Russian. So I took it upon myself to monitor the email and get the build working over the Christmas holidays. I remember on Christmas day &lt;a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-6471">I was conversing with&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://de.linkedin.com/in/jonnyzzz">Eugene Pentrenko&lt;/a> across the world about how to deal with the complexities of TFS pulling thousands of files and then building them*.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years later, almost all of our products build with TeamCity, and we have thousands of integration tests and tens of thousands unit tests that run on our 100+ build agents to make it happen. It is central to everything we do. And it all started one Christmas years ago when I had a &amp;ldquo;moral duty&amp;rdquo; to do something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the book &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KPM424/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B008KPM424&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=hedgeopscom-20&amp;amp;linkId=52YQPMBZ7Z4IMUKU">Selling with Noble Purpose&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href="http://www.mcleodandmore.com/what-is-selling-with-noble-purpose/">Lisa McLeod&lt;/a> leads the reader through an exercise where the reader thinks about situations where one makes a difference with customers, in a different way than other people, while loving what they are doing. When I went through this exercise I was reminded of this story. Through the exercise I found my noble purpose:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I share tools and insight for success&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what truly excites me, and why this blog exists. I want to share the tools and insights I&amp;rsquo;ve found to succeed. I want to help those who have given me tools and insights that have made me more effective by spreading them to others. And I want to properly define success so I can make sure to follow the path that will lead me there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next few posts, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about key elements of &lt;em>true&lt;/em> success. Success is one of those things that seems easy to see in others, but never seems recognizable in ourselves. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a few reasons why this is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>_* You can&amp;rsquo;t see it in the issue I link to above but Eugene was emailing me and went above and beyond, after his normal hours, to resolve the issue._&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
