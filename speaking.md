**The New Diagnostic Utility**, NCR Techfest 2014 in Grapevine, TX
  
_June 7, 2014_
  
I spoke on a new tool that is available <a title="Aloha Update" href="http://www.radiantupdate.com" target="_blank">on Aloha Update</a> that helps diagnose environmental issues in a site or lab that prevent our products from properly running. In the session I mentioned key elements of our strategy: how we have to focus on a <a title="Safety Net" href="http://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/" target="_blank">Safety Net</a> before we make broader changes, how we have avoided The Grand Vision (coming soon) in our solution in order to focus on value now, and how we have focused on Surprise (coming soon), which has kept us from focusing on the future and instead deliver in the present.
