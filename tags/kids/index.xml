&lt;p>As a part of the &lt;a href="http://hourofcode.com/us">hour of code&lt;/a> initiative, I was pleased to present my perspective on computer programming to first and third graders at &lt;a href="http://www.gcisd-k12.org/Domain/1675">Grapevine Elementary School&lt;/a> in December. Through the presentation I was able to inspire the students to see programming in their future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been frustrated over the years with how little people know about programming. When I ask an eight year old what they want to do when they grow up, you get a lot of firemen, police officers, teachers, and professional athletes. When children of today grow up they will more likely work closely with computers, regardless of their profession. No one will be exempt. So it&amp;rsquo;s important for them to view programming as a tool, like math, reading, or writing, that is to be used to create value for others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I talked about the people who made this toy, the producers, and the people who bought it, the consumers. When they grow up and produce, they&amp;rsquo;ll produce solutions that use computers in awesome ways. We call that programming. They&amp;rsquo;ll call it normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ended the presentation with some myths related to programming:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Myth&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Reality&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>It&amp;rsquo;s only for video games&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Programming is for solving problems. Problems are everywhere, not just in video games&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>It&amp;rsquo;s only for adults&lt;/td>
&lt;td>My son learning &lt;a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby&lt;/a> through &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy&lt;/a> and using &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>It&amp;rsquo;s too complicated&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Actually trying to solve a complicated problem &lt;em>without&lt;/em> the help of a computer is complicated. Illiterate people think that reading is complicated. This is just another form of literacy.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Computers will take over the world and we won&amp;rsquo;t need humans anymore&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Computers do one thing well: do what they&amp;rsquo;re told. You can&amp;rsquo;t reduce love, empathy, and character to a set of instructions. Being able to work with other people is essential to one&amp;rsquo;s development and ultimate economic value to the world.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>My son and I are working through his math homework using Ruby right now. If that goes well I might post a few YouTube videos explaining it. I think there is a large, untapped group of people who would really be interested in finding programming literacy from a young age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to think Mrs. Cox&amp;rsquo;s fourth grade class for the encouraging thank-you notes on the presentation. You guys don&amp;rsquo;t know how much those meant to me. I also want to thank &lt;a href="http://www.gcisd-k12.org/Domain/2938">Nancy Hale&lt;/a> for setting it up and encouraging kids to learn coding.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solve Problems by Isolating Them</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/solve-problems-by-isolating-them/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2014 08:02:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/solve-problems-by-isolating-them/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>My kids have been drawn into the world of Legos. They love &lt;a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/ninjago">Ninjago&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/">The Lego Movie&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It turns out there is a &lt;a href="http://www.legolanddiscoverycenter.com/dallasfw/">Legoland Discovery center&lt;/a> nearby. The other day they went to a birthday party there. The kids had an absolute blast. Legos, legos everywhere. It was totally awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also turns out that we have a &lt;a href="https://www.sixflags.com/overtexas">Six Flags&lt;/a> nearby. Fast roller coasters. Every amusement park craziness imaginable. We spent last summer doing that, and let me tell you, mom and I really got sick of it. But the kids absolutely loved it. They even wanted to do it again this summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So DFW area: lego land: check. amusement park: check. &lt;a href="http://california.legoland.com/">lego amusement park&lt;/a>? That will be a trip to California and $4000 please.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how &lt;strong>the solution to a problem gets a lot more complicated and a lot more expensive when you combine it with another problem.&lt;/strong> I come across this a lot at work. I ruthlessly go through a project and eliminate anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t needed, because I want to ship it as quickly as possible and I know every little thing just adds to the time and complexity and makes the project that much more unrealistic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So are we going to the LegoLand California Resort? If we do it, it will be with [My kids have been drawn into the world of Legos.
