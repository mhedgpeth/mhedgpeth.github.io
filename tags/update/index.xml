&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Taos, New Mexico with my family and have been thinking a lot about things. I thought it would be a good time to share with you more about where I&amp;rsquo;ve been, where I&amp;rsquo;m going, and what you can do to help me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="a-retrospective">A Retrospective&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When I planned out how I would start my blog, I planned five different series of posts, four of which have been published:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction:&lt;/strong> This shares some of my core values and lets you get to know me a bit. I naturally gravitated toward &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">contentment&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-masquerading-as-success/">appropriate definition of success&lt;/a>. These topics have still remained very interesting to me and were fun to write. I think these posts are probably the closest to where I think this blog is headed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lessons Learned on my Install/Diagnostic Utility project:&lt;/strong> This coincided with speaking about it. These posts weren&amp;rsquo;t very popular; the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/">safety net&lt;/a> post barely hit the top twenty. I had thought that there might be some more interest in the work-related sphere for lessons learned/etc., but there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Finances:&lt;/strong> Next I wrote about our financial story, which has played a big part in my character development in the last five years. This series was the most popular one, largely because I shared it on the &lt;a href="http://forum.youneedabudget.com/discussion/31368/success-story-posted-on-my-blog">You Need a Budget forum&lt;/a>. It was fun to write, especially when I write about the philosophy and mindset &lt;em>behind&lt;/em> making good financial decisions. I don&amp;rsquo;t read very many people writing about that, and think I may have insights in that area that can help people. The most popular posts in this series are also the most popular posts in the first two months: &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/">the introduction to the story&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/month-ahead/">how I got a month ahead with YNAB&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lessons learned on my long-term Autopilot project:&lt;/strong> This coincided with speaking about it to our User Summit in Huntington Beach. The lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned have been valuable to me and I enjoyed sharing them, but my audience shrank during this series. This highlights a key surprise from the first couple of months: I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to get any traction or response from what I do professionally. If I talk broadly about what I do professionally, people enjoy it, but the more detailed I get the less response I get from it. That&amp;rsquo;s a strange reality that I want to understand more deeply, but I won&amp;rsquo;t do an entire series related just to a work environment before I know that it will be well received.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Getting Things Done:&lt;/strong> The next series I will write about how &lt;a href="http://checkvist.com">Checkvist&lt;/a> has helped me implement the Getting Things Done system and has increased my productivity to previously unimaginable levels. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about this series because using this tool has created a breakthrough for me that has truly been revolutionary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-purpose">My Purpose&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I write this blog for four reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I want to create a network of people who want to grow and intentionally live a better life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to grow as a writer and a speaker because I enjoy helping others win.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to help the vendors who have made me successful, giving back to those who have given so much to me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to explore which of my ideas and passions resonates with an audience so I can know which paths my career can take me.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So far I have learned a ton and have enjoyed the work that has gone into this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-future">The Future&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I can already tell by how this first two months have gone that I want to write more about intentional, contented living. I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few books on this and will unpack it in August and beyond. I&amp;rsquo;m seeing by the response that these types of posts are the most helpful to people, and they are the most fulfilling for me to write.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-i-want-from-you">&lt;strong>What do I want from you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Subscribe to my email updates.&lt;/strong> This is on the right side of the posts and is the easiest way to be a regular reader.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tell people about posts you like.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s really encouraging to see responses in social media/etc., so the more you do this the more you support what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and encourage me. Use the icons on the bottom of each post to easily do this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Comment/Respond.&lt;/strong> If you&amp;rsquo;re an early reader of my blog and you like what I&amp;rsquo;m writing, you&amp;rsquo;re an important part of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. If you like something, please tell me through a comment or &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/contact/">contact me&lt;/a>. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like a particular post or idea, tell me that too! It&amp;rsquo;s helpful to be able to hear from you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you one way or another: &lt;strong>What about the first couple of months have you enjoyed the most? What would you like to read more about?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
