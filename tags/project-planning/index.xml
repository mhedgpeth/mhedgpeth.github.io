&lt;p>The room was standing room only. I was playing &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1tj2zJ2Wvg">Welcome to the Jungle&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; as loud as my company-issued laptop would play. There was a considerable buzz in the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/speaking/">speaking at a conference session&lt;/a> entitled &amp;ldquo;The New Diagnostic Utility.&amp;rdquo; This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Get Rich Quick with Flipping Real Estate conference session. This was The Diagnostic Utility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What was so jarring about this experience was the lackluster response I had gotten to this tool up until this point. The idea came &lt;a href="www.linkedin.com/in/nicolemillspmp">from a colleague&lt;/a> that dealt with diagnosing environmental issues in sites. She and her team were excited about it. I understood the need. But no one else seemed to be enthused. Why not?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The conference I was at was full of people who install our software at restaurants all over North America. They had issues that needed to be diagnosed. The title &amp;ldquo;The Diagnostic Utility&amp;rdquo; was translated to them like &amp;ldquo;Save Yourself Hours of Time Making Sure You Did Everything Right&amp;rdquo;. This was the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/">safety net&lt;/a> they needed. Their attendance and enthusiasm confirmed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is probably the most valuable lesson I&amp;rsquo;ve learned this year: &lt;strong>a solution is only effective when it is &lt;em>in the hands&lt;/em> of the one that has a problem.&lt;/strong> Not the one that &lt;em>knows&lt;/em> about the problem. Not even the one who is &lt;em>losing money&lt;/em> on the problem. &lt;strong>The one who has the problem.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when your kid doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to get to school on time, the solution is waking up earlier, but it&amp;rsquo;s only effective when your kid &lt;em>wants&lt;/em> to be on time to school to avoid a consequence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a project is proposed but the people who own that process don&amp;rsquo;t believe there&amp;rsquo;s a problem, you don&amp;rsquo;t do the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you&amp;rsquo;re getting frustrated that a customer isn&amp;rsquo;t responsive enough to your solution, perhaps they don&amp;rsquo;t see there is a problem and perhaps you need to find another customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was the case for The New Diagnostic Utility. Once I found the right audience, everything fell into place.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
