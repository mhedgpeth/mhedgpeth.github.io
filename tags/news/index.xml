&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bumper to bumper traffic. Lights ahead. An ambulance speeds by in the shoulder lane.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We inch by for a few minutes, and finally make it to the accident. Then something inevitable happens:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OMG what happened!?!?! I need to brake and see what happened! Are they going to be OK? Do I know them? Is there&amp;hellip;BLOOD?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rubbernecking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is exactly what is happening in the local news. I&amp;rsquo;d like to give you a test to take right now:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Go to your &lt;a href="http://www.wfaa.com">local news site&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Count how many articles that fulfill this criteria:
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>You will remember them a month from now&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You didn&amp;rsquo;t hear about them from another source&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They will affect your life in some way&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I just did this as of this writing, on September 5. I counted zero articles. I think that you might come up with a similar amount.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s going on here?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We like knowing that no matter how bad things are for us, or how crappy our day is, there are at least a few people on the news that have it worse.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What value does this serve us? Logically speaking, absolutely none. This is a worthless activity. It isn&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/sports-news-soap-operas-for-people-who-make-fun-of-soap-operas/">entertaining like sports&lt;/a>. It has no significance in the lifes and livelihood of all but a very small number of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;m trying to wean myself off of my local news addiction. I&amp;rsquo;m not replacing it with anything. I&amp;rsquo;m just stopping. I&amp;rsquo;ve had varying degrees of success over the past few months, because I love reading the local news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worthless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope to fully believe that one day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sports News: Soap Operas for People Who Make Fun of Soap Operas</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/sports-news-soap-operas-for-people-who-make-fun-of-soap-operas/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 08:00:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/sports-news-soap-operas-for-people-who-make-fun-of-soap-operas/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In the past I used to listen to &lt;em>The Ticket&lt;/em> every day on the way to and from work. I would follow the local teams through ups and downs. When the Dallas Cowboys won their only playoff game in the last almost twenty years, I was turning on The Ticket to hear their analysis. When the Mavericks won their World Championship a few years ago, I celebrated with my friends on the Ticket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I realized something:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sports News is even more worthless than &amp;ldquo;Real&amp;rdquo; News.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, you are hearing me correctly. I &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/">just finished&lt;/a> outlining everything wasteful and dumb about CNN and Fox News, but I&amp;rsquo;m saying sports news is even worse than that. The difference: at least in &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; news we are talking about people&amp;rsquo;s lives and well being. In sports we are talking about a game using the same medium and tone that we talk about people&amp;rsquo;s lives and well being.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of observations really hit this home for me:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sports news &lt;em>loves&lt;/em> the soap opera story.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s funny to think that way, too, since so many sports fans are uber-masculine and would never admit to enjoying soap operas as entertainment. A few examples (as you read these in the tone of an airhead woman in her early twenties talking about a soap opera):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>_OMG did you hear about** &lt;a href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/mlb/story/_/id/11471420/ron-washington-quits-manager-texas-rangers">Ron Washington&lt;/a>?** He RESIGNED today as manager of the Rangers for personal reasons. Jon Daniels says it ISN&amp;rsquo;T about drugs. But who knows? I wonder how the players are feeling?_&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OMG did you hear about the &lt;a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/blog/nfl/rumors/post/_/id/24032/will-refs-pocket-flags-in-regular-season">number of penalties being called in NFL preseason&lt;/a>? I wonder if, like, the NFL will call those during the REGULAR SEASON!?!?! This might like change the whole game.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OMG, did you &lt;a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/denver-broncos/post/_/id/8501/wes-welker-roundup-everything-you-need-to-know-about-his-suspension">hear that Wes Welker&lt;/a> is SUSPENDED for FOUR GAMES for taking drugs? I wonder what drugs they are????&amp;hellip;!?!?!?!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is all of this about?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like the news, this is about sucking people into intrigue over things that don&amp;rsquo;t matter so they&amp;rsquo;ll be sitting there when the advertising comes on. &lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s about selling you stuff you normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t buy.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does the nature of Ron Washington&amp;rsquo;s resignation matter? No.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is there any effect that you can have on the number of NFL penalties by reading the article? No. No effect. You. Are. Wasting. Your. Time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does it matter what Wes Welker did or did not do? To him and his family, it means he makes a few hundred thousand less from multiple millions. To us, it means nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It means nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let that sink in, sports fans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is entertainment. It&amp;rsquo;s not your life. It&amp;rsquo;s not your family. It&amp;rsquo;s not your livelihood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s a business run by people who make a lot of money tricking you into thinking it matters.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in perspective, by all means go to a game or watch it on TV and enjoy. But leave it at that, and find better things to do with your time. Over time, even that will begin to fade away.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Economist Keeps it Real</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-economist-keeps-it-real/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2014 08:00:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-economist-keeps-it-real/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-the-economist-keeps-it-real.jpg" alt="Economist" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Over the past year I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to see &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/">the absolute insanity&lt;/a> of following the news on normal news sites like CNN or Fox News. You might be thinking that I have no clue what is going on in the world. I do value being an educated person who knows about world events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a secret weapon that helps me get this insight into the world without driving myself crazy day to day. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.subscriptionaddiction.com/magazines/subscription/the-economist-magazine-magazine.jsp">a paper subscription&lt;/a> to &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist magazine&lt;/a>. Here are seven things I love about having a paper subscription to The Economist:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>International.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s not focused on Americans only. I get more of an insight into the world than the typical American news outlets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Soap Opera Free.&lt;/strong> It doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to get me sucked into idiotic stories about how people are going to react to this or that, or worse what a celebrity was doing last Friday night. I want to be an educated man who knows world events…not a celebrity gossip connoisseur. The subscription keeps everything serious and leaves the rest out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Distraction Free.&lt;/strong> When I read the magazine, I don&amp;rsquo;t see emails popping up. My kids don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m playing video games. They know I&amp;rsquo;m reading a serious news magazine. And when I put it down, I do something else. I don&amp;rsquo;t get sucked into ten hours of mindless video watching. &lt;strong>This is a feature and not a bug.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not Republican or Democrat.&lt;/strong> I love it that I get out of the false American dichotomy of Republican and Democrat with the magazine. It has no interest in getting me to be &lt;em>more&lt;/em> one way or another. It just calls it like it sees it. Which is probably more of a Libertarian bent but honestly it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to tell sometimes. And that&amp;rsquo;s how I would like to take my news. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be told what to think. I want some facts and fair analysis and I want to think about it myself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Weekly.&lt;/strong> I don&amp;rsquo;t think that the appropriate news cadence should be any more frequent than once a week. If something is important I&amp;rsquo;m going to find out about it. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to spend every day reading the news. It just doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter that much. So the fact that the Economist is weekly is perfect for me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Guilt Free to Skip.&lt;/strong> This isn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; of the magazine as much as it is for me. If I had a weekly subscription and didn&amp;rsquo;t read &lt;em>any&lt;/em> of it, I still think it would be worth it. Why? Because it kept me from the hours per day of distraction I had been getting by going to news sites. So the Economist can be skipped just fine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Diversified.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s not just a political magazine. It also has stuff on business, technology, science. It has special features that bring you up to speed on a topic in depth.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I have subscribed to the Economist for months now and absolutely love it. I highly recommend you ditch your current news habit and buy an Economist subscription. I did some searching and found a deeply discounted deal &lt;a href="http://www.subscriptionaddiction.com/magazines/subscription/the-economist-magazine-magazine.jsp">here&lt;/a>. Try it and you&amp;rsquo;ll be hooked. If you run into me personally, I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to give you a copy so you can see what I&amp;rsquo;m saying; just ask.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Escaping with the News</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2014 08:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I was having a great time at a party at my house recently, when a friend of mine who is quite conservative started talking to me about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Benghazi_attack">the Benghazi incident of September 2012&lt;/a>. He went on and on about how outrageous it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I respond, &amp;ldquo;I just don&amp;rsquo;t see how any of this is important or relevant to my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With an outraged tone, he responds with eyes wide open in outrage, &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t think &lt;em>Benghazi&lt;/em> is important???&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To my life? No, I don&amp;rsquo;t. In fact I can take that a step further: &lt;strong>the news, especially political news is designed to get people to get outraged over things that are not in their power to change or influence.&lt;/strong> This state of frustration and anger puts them in a place where they are willing to buy more things in the advertisements, which is good for the provider of the outrageous news. But for the person who is consuming it, it is the very definition of a waste of time: spending time on something one doesn&amp;rsquo;t find enjoying, can&amp;rsquo;t do anything about, and causes them to act in ways that are outside of their values. This is insanity!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to propose we ask a question about every news article that we consume from now on: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>How will my life change as a result of me knowing this information?&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I propose the answer is, for the most part, &amp;ldquo;none at all&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To illustrate, let&amp;rsquo;s comment on some CNN and Fox News headlines as of the date of first writing this, July 26, 2014:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Story&lt;/th>
&lt;th>How will my life change as a result of me knowing this information&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/26/world/meast/mideast-crisis/index.html?hpt=hp_t1">Rockets fired; Israel-Hamas truce appears over&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. The rockets likely won&amp;rsquo;t make it to North Texas. There is no election today to influence our political establishment, and political leadership in the U.S. seem to be aligned (for the most part).&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/26/world/africa/libya-us-embassy-evacuation/index.html?hpt=hp_t2">U.S. evacuates embassy in Tripoli&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I am in North Texas, not Tripoli. I have nothing to be afraid of by whatever is happening there.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/26/joe-paterno-feared-wrongly-accusing-sandusky-son-says/?intcmp=latestnews">Joe Paterno Feared Wrongly Accusing Sandusky, Son Says&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I am not nor do I have any friends who are a part of this case. While it is a tragedy, me knowing about the state of mind of one of the participants of the case, who is now dead, will have no bearing on the outcome of the case whatsoever.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/26/officials-cite-marijuana-as-reason-for-rise-in-denver-homeless/?intcmp=latestnews">Officials cite marijuana as reason for rise in Denver homeless&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I live in North Texas, not Denver. I do not use marijuana. I suppose if I did this news article wouldn&amp;rsquo;t change my mind about it. There is no marijuana vote on the Texas ballot today for me to vote on.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/07/26/some-in-cia-torture-report-denied-chance-to-read-it/?intcmp=latestnews">Some in CIA &amp;lsquo;torture&amp;rsquo; report denied chance to read it&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I am not subject to torture or defining what torture is in the coming months as far as I know. In fact if I were to be tortured, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that this report would have anything to do with how I would be treated.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/26/colorado-business-owner-fights-back-after-falling-victim-to-caller-id-spoofing/?intcmp=latestnews">Colorado business owner fights back after falling victim to &amp;lsquo;caller ID spoofing'&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I have managed to live my life for 35 years without knowing what the term &amp;ldquo;caller id spoofing&amp;rdquo; means. Even if there were a risk, I suppose I would hear about it from the phone company. The fact that it&amp;rsquo;s on a news site tells me that it is a rare occurrence. Besides, I don&amp;rsquo;t even own a business so there is absolutely no chance of anything in this article affecting my life.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/07/26/fast-food-workers-vow-civil-disobedience-in-wage-fight/?intcmp=latestnews">Fast food workers vow civil disobedience in wage fight&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None. I don&amp;rsquo;t work at McDonald&amp;rsquo;s. I also don&amp;rsquo;t eat there very often. I suppose if their wages do go up, the price of a Happy Meal will eventually go up, thus creating an unexpected surprise on the rare occasion that I go to McDonalds. But we&amp;rsquo;re quite a ways from this: they are &lt;em>vowing &lt;/em>civil disobedience. Nothing has actually happened. This affects my life in no way whatsoever.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Let me give you a little guarantee: If you play this game for a few days on the news sites you are visiting, you will very quickly be awakened to the reality that this all is a complete and total waste of your time. &lt;strong>You are a pawn in someone else&amp;rsquo;s game to get you to buy stuff.&lt;/strong> There actually isn&amp;rsquo;t news on almost every day. And when there is it can be summed up in a ten second brief description.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So let&amp;rsquo;s stop investing so much time in &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; and make some &lt;em>real&lt;/em> news in our own lives.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
