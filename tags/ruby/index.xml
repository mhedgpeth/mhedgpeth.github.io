&lt;p>When I started &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">learning Chef&lt;/a> in earnest I realized quickly that my need to know what was happening was leading me to need to dive into a book on Ruby and figure out what all the magic I was seeing in Chef was really about. Chef has an amazing way of being usable for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know much Ruby, but I&amp;rsquo;m the curious type that just needs to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started out with &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/13QZz1v">The Ruby Programming Language&lt;/a> but found it to be too much of a reference work that basically stated facts about the language instead of walking the reader through the learning process. I was delighted to find &lt;a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby&lt;/a> to be exactly that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was able to get through the book in a few days. It starts you out with objects, which for Ruby is the right place to start out. As I&amp;rsquo;m teaching my son how to program, the concept of objects is very easy for him to pick up. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to start with primitives, then control flow, then objects for people to learn. Learning is less logically structured than that. People don&amp;rsquo;t think like computers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each chapter in the book is about fifteen to twenty minutes of time investment and walks you through an example that you can easily code on your own. I find that when learning these things, I can&amp;rsquo;t just read it and know it. I need to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> something as well. This book did a great job at keeping me engaged with my ruby interpreter as well as with my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In November I set a goal to be working with Ruby every day by February. This book did a great job at making the goal possible. It demystified how Chef was doing its magic, but it has done so much more. It has opened me up to a whole new world of possibilities by quickly being able to script a solution to a problem without having to go through all the hoops of a statically typed programming language. While I still love C# and will use it for certain problems, Ruby is not a part of my life, thanks partly to this excellent book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coding for Kids</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/coding-for-kids/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 08:00:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/coding-for-kids/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;p>As a part of the &lt;a href="http://hourofcode.com/us">hour of code&lt;/a> initiative, I was pleased to present my perspective on computer programming to first and third graders at &lt;a href="http://www.gcisd-k12.org/Domain/1675">Grapevine Elementary School&lt;/a> in December. Through the presentation I was able to inspire the students to see programming in their future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been frustrated over the years with how little people know about programming. When I ask an eight year old what they want to do when they grow up, you get a lot of firemen, police officers, teachers, and professional athletes. When children of today grow up they will more likely work closely with computers, regardless of their profession. No one will be exempt. So it&amp;rsquo;s important for them to view programming as a tool, like math, reading, or writing, that is to be used to create value for others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I talked about the people who made this toy, the producers, and the people who bought it, the consumers. When they grow up and produce, they&amp;rsquo;ll produce solutions that use computers in awesome ways. We call that programming. They&amp;rsquo;ll call it normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ended the presentation with some myths related to programming:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Myth&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Reality&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>It&amp;rsquo;s only for video games&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Programming is for solving problems. Problems are everywhere, not just in video games&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>It&amp;rsquo;s only for adults&lt;/td>
&lt;td>My son learning &lt;a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby&lt;/a> through &lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy&lt;/a> and using &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>It&amp;rsquo;s too complicated&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Actually trying to solve a complicated problem &lt;em>without&lt;/em> the help of a computer is complicated. Illiterate people think that reading is complicated. This is just another form of literacy.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Computers will take over the world and we won&amp;rsquo;t need humans anymore&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Computers do one thing well: do what they&amp;rsquo;re told. You can&amp;rsquo;t reduce love, empathy, and character to a set of instructions. Being able to work with other people is essential to one&amp;rsquo;s development and ultimate economic value to the world.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>My son and I are working through his math homework using Ruby right now. If that goes well I might post a few YouTube videos explaining it. I think there is a large, untapped group of people who would really be interested in finding programming literacy from a young age.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to think Mrs. Cox&amp;rsquo;s fourth grade class for the encouraging thank-you notes on the presentation. You guys don&amp;rsquo;t know how much those meant to me. I also want to thank &lt;a href="http://www.gcisd-k12.org/Domain/2938">Nancy Hale&lt;/a> for setting it up and encouraging kids to learn coding.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
