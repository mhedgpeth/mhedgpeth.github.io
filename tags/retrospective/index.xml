&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been about six months since &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/">I started this blog&lt;/a> and I thought it&amp;rsquo;s time for a retrospective. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoye talking about issues and ideas that have really helped me find new insight and motivation for where I&amp;rsquo;d like to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed, I have had a bit of a content categorization problem that I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the answer to. Let me explain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The motivation of starting my blog was pretty clear to me from the beginning:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/">Michael Hyatt&lt;/a> convinced me in &lt;a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/093-10-reasons-every-leader-needs-a-blog-podcast.html">a podcast&lt;/a> that by not having a platform for my ideas I was not going to be an effective influencer. The path to scaling influence is through creating a platform. The easiest way to begin building a platform is through a blog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I wanted to find a way to find like-minded people who could influence me, and who I could influence&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I wanted to solidify a lot of what I was learning by writing about it and explaining it&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I started out early by writing about a lot of professional topics, then some financial management topics. I saw very quickly that it would not be easy to build a professional oriented platform; the interest wasn&amp;rsquo;t there. The interest appeared to be there for the more personal oriented topics, so I went in that direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve written more and more about the ideas and experiences that I have found useful to accomplish my goals, and my readership has gone down and down. For example in July the readership numbers spiked at 50 or so sessions per day. At the moment the spike is more like 20 per day when I publish something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/post-assets/2014-12-08-a-look-around/site-metrics.png" alt="Site Metrics">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not bad that 20 or so people are reading the blog, but the problem is that a good portion of that are my extended family that I could easily (and more persuasively) share a personal conversation. So it&amp;rsquo;s clear right now that I need a change in strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I continue to work on deployment both for our hosted and our store products at my company. I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot of lessons, both through management and through learning new products. In fact I&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time learning in the past eight weeks than I had in the past three years combined. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about where these ideas will take us, and want to share it with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re one of my readers who won&amp;rsquo;t care about that topic, I want to tell you two things. First, thanks for reading and for sticking with me. Second, I&amp;rsquo;d love to have lunch with you and talk about these topics further. I have a passion for living life well and think that in order to do that one must get off of the normal path set by us by our culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For everyone else, welcome to the new hedge-ops, which asks the question: &lt;strong>how can we operate most efficiently with management in technology&lt;/strong>. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to writing about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July Blog Update</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/july-2014-update/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2014 08:00:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/july-2014-update/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-july-2014-update.jpg" alt="Update" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This week I&amp;rsquo;m in Taos, New Mexico with my family and have been thinking a lot about things. I thought it would be a good time to share with you more about where I&amp;rsquo;ve been, where I&amp;rsquo;m going, and what you can do to help me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="a-retrospective">A Retrospective&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When I planned out how I would start my blog, I planned five different series of posts, four of which have been published:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Introduction:&lt;/strong> This shares some of my core values and lets you get to know me a bit. I naturally gravitated toward &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/">contentment&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-masquerading-as-success/">appropriate definition of success&lt;/a>. These topics have still remained very interesting to me and were fun to write. I think these posts are probably the closest to where I think this blog is headed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lessons Learned on my Install/Diagnostic Utility project:&lt;/strong> This coincided with speaking about it. These posts weren&amp;rsquo;t very popular; the &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/">safety net&lt;/a> post barely hit the top twenty. I had thought that there might be some more interest in the work-related sphere for lessons learned/etc., but there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Finances:&lt;/strong> Next I wrote about our financial story, which has played a big part in my character development in the last five years. This series was the most popular one, largely because I shared it on the &lt;a href="http://forum.youneedabudget.com/discussion/31368/success-story-posted-on-my-blog">You Need a Budget forum&lt;/a>. It was fun to write, especially when I write about the philosophy and mindset &lt;em>behind&lt;/em> making good financial decisions. I don&amp;rsquo;t read very many people writing about that, and think I may have insights in that area that can help people. The most popular posts in this series are also the most popular posts in the first two months: &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/">the introduction to the story&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/month-ahead/">how I got a month ahead with YNAB&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Lessons learned on my long-term Autopilot project:&lt;/strong> This coincided with speaking about it to our User Summit in Huntington Beach. The lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned have been valuable to me and I enjoyed sharing them, but my audience shrank during this series. This highlights a key surprise from the first couple of months: I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to get any traction or response from what I do professionally. If I talk broadly about what I do professionally, people enjoy it, but the more detailed I get the less response I get from it. That&amp;rsquo;s a strange reality that I want to understand more deeply, but I won&amp;rsquo;t do an entire series related just to a work environment before I know that it will be well received.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Getting Things Done:&lt;/strong> The next series I will write about how &lt;a href="http://checkvist.com">Checkvist&lt;/a> has helped me implement the Getting Things Done system and has increased my productivity to previously unimaginable levels. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about this series because using this tool has created a breakthrough for me that has truly been revolutionary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-purpose">My Purpose&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I write this blog for four reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I want to create a network of people who want to grow and intentionally live a better life.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to grow as a writer and a speaker because I enjoy helping others win.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to help the vendors who have made me successful, giving back to those who have given so much to me.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I want to explore which of my ideas and passions resonates with an audience so I can know which paths my career can take me.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So far I have learned a ton and have enjoyed the work that has gone into this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-future">The Future&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I can already tell by how this first two months have gone that I want to write more about intentional, contented living. I&amp;rsquo;ve read a few books on this and will unpack it in August and beyond. I&amp;rsquo;m seeing by the response that these types of posts are the most helpful to people, and they are the most fulfilling for me to write.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-do-i-want-from-you">&lt;strong>What do I want from you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Subscribe to my email updates.&lt;/strong> This is on the right side of the posts and is the easiest way to be a regular reader.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tell people about posts you like.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s really encouraging to see responses in social media/etc., so the more you do this the more you support what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and encourage me. Use the icons on the bottom of each post to easily do this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Comment/Respond.&lt;/strong> If you&amp;rsquo;re an early reader of my blog and you like what I&amp;rsquo;m writing, you&amp;rsquo;re an important part of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. If you like something, please tell me through a comment or &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/contact/">contact me&lt;/a>. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like a particular post or idea, tell me that too! It&amp;rsquo;s helpful to be able to hear from you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you one way or another: &lt;strong>What about the first couple of months have you enjoyed the most? What would you like to read more about?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ten Takeaways from the Last 10 Years at Radiant/NCR</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2014 08:00:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Five thousand, four hundred and thirty two dollars and twenty three cents&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Five thousand, four hun…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, we will take your home next Tuesday if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay us five thousand, four hundred and thirty-two dollars and twenty three cents.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry there&amp;rsquo;s nothing else we can do for you&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, you will lose your house next Tuesday if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay us fi….&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yes, thank you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was where I had found myself in the spring of 2004. For some reason, I thought it was a great idea to accept a developer position at a Law Firm that specialized in foreclosures. In some cosmic twist, they sat me in the cubicle next to the lady who was delivering the bad news to people. All day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to get out of there. But to where? A recruiter had told me about this place that was a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_Systems">&lt;em>real&lt;/em> software company&lt;/a> that created a POS for restaurants called Aloha. I was done being the IT department. I wanted to be a part of a &lt;em>real&lt;/em> software company. So on July 12, 2004, ten years from tomorrow, I started working at Radiant Systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I arrived ten years ago a mid-level software engineer whose confidence was shaken by all the foreclosures I had to hear about, and a rough few years of post-Y2K job market crappiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking back, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown so much. Here are ten takeaways from the last ten years at Radiant/NCR:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Speak Up.&lt;/strong> Early on I developed an opinion on what needed to change about my team&amp;rsquo;s situation, and I spoke up and did something about it. This fueled even more change, and gave me a reputation for leadership, which opened up so many opportunities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make a List.&lt;/strong> When I started, I worked with a friend that always made lists, and I thought that was strange at first. But then I realized my colleague always got stuff done quicker than me. So I made a list, and got stuff done as well. People aren&amp;rsquo;t organized because they are dorks that like inane details; they&amp;rsquo;re organized because it works.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Do it Right, But Do it Fast.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;ve been passionate about doing things well for a long time. But I realized early on that the only way to do this is to get fast at developing software. I needed to take advantage of tools that I had available to me and get smart about getting things done, so I could have time to get it right.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tools Matter.&lt;/strong> I don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a super-genius to be effective. Really I just need to use the right tools, and let my teams and company for that matter use those tools to be more effective. That way I win, everyone wins, and we can be more focused on the problem at hand. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love tools. It&amp;rsquo;s a win for everyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t be Religious about Process.&lt;/strong> Early on I was very religious about being agile, doing test-driven development, whatever. I&amp;rsquo;ve realized over the years that it&amp;rsquo;s much more valuable to use those frameworks as starting points to solve the problem in front of you. If you solve problems, you get things done, and create a profit for your company. It seems so elementary that one should make more money for one&amp;rsquo;s company than they cost, but the honest truth is the degree to which you do that is the degree to which you will have flexibility on everything else: money, what you work on, flexibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Be Patient.&lt;/strong> I can think over the past ten years of so many times where things weren&amp;rsquo;t going well, or where I wanted something to change so badly. Eventually it did. Like I say above, if you create value, that value is rewarded. So focus on the value, not on the drama or the desire to change everything overnight.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>You Live with the Past Forever, so get the Present Right.&lt;/strong> I am at a conference in Huntington Beach this week and was at breakfast overhearing two of our users argue about the proper approach to a weakness in a product…that I created seven years ago. It was a strange feeling that I had so much impact on these people so many years later. What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the years, is that you have to live with the past for a long time, especially when you move projects and can&amp;rsquo;t influence the product directly, so get it right today because you never know what tomorrow will bring.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Value is Immune to Change.&lt;/strong> In the last ten years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been through the worst recession ever, an acquisition from Radiant to NCR, and numerous other business cycle downturns and upswings. In every one of those, I&amp;rsquo;ve thrived. Why? Because I&amp;rsquo;ve focused on bringing value to my employer beyond what they pay me. If one is valuable, change doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. Even if the company folds, that value can be transferred elsewhere. So I don&amp;rsquo;t worry about change; I worry about value.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without Sales, Software is Dead.&lt;/strong> There is a sales guy at this conference who is the center of attention. He&amp;rsquo;s laughing, drinking, yucking it up with the customers. And they love it. For years, the software engineer in me despised it. &amp;ldquo;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the first thing about software&amp;rdquo; I would tell myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned recently though that without sales and marketing, software is only an idea that dies quickly. Software &lt;em>needs&lt;/em> to be sold, and that usually happens by people who actually had friends in High School. Sales is a valuable aspect of software and must be rewarded.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Show Grattitude.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;ve had  my share of ups and downs in the past ten years. But when I look back, these ten years have completely changed my life. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have gotten there without John Pearson, Vince Severns, Jeff Hughes, Jimmy Fortuna, and Honza Fedak helping me through, and the numerous team members and other leaders who have believed in me. I&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way since I was grimacing next to the lady explaining the foreclosure to the poor soul on the other line. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very open with people about how great this journey has been for me.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item></channel></rss>
