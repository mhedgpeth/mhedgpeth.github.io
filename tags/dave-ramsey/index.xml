&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/you-need-a-budget/">YNAB&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/move-the-needle-with-dave-ramsey/">Dave Ramsey&lt;/a> entered our lives, we became an unstoppable force to meet our financial goals. Our original debt payoff forecasts were beat by a mile, largely because we got serious and focused all of our time, energy, and money to debt payoff. We had met some really great goals and were feeling great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there was a problem. After we met our debt payoff goal, the angels did not descend from the heavens and make everything better. And there was still an insatiable appetite for more stuff. The only difference was that now I had more money to spend on getting that stuff. It was like we had finished a long diet but did nothing about our love of ice cream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we got more stuff for a few months. And I felt the same. Dave Ramsey has a saying, &amp;ldquo;Live like no one else, so that later you can live like no one else.&amp;rdquo; We had lived like no one else, so that later…we would get depressed about how meaningless it all is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem: you&amp;rsquo;ll never win with discontentment. You never find enough. You&amp;rsquo;re always wanting more. So in the long run, the &amp;ldquo;sacrifice now&amp;rdquo; will not lead to peace and balance later, because you&amp;rsquo;re training yourself for discontentment. Let&amp;rsquo;s illustrate this in other areas of life:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>With&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Live like no one else looks like&lt;/th>
&lt;th>But contenment looks like&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Dieting&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to join crossfit and do that multiple times a week, and eat Paleo and judge everyone else who doesn&amp;rsquo;t as idiots&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to learn how to enjoy the calories I really need, appreciating that I&amp;rsquo;m swimming in a sea of cheap calories that kings of old didn&amp;rsquo;t have&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Work&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to make this happen and work Saturdays and drive everyone to do the same…this is going to launch my career into the stratosphere&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to really think about what and how I&amp;rsquo;m doing things, and make sure I do the right things with the right team, and do those things well&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Marriage&lt;/td>
&lt;td>We&amp;rsquo;re going to go to counseling, a marriage retreat, and then sit down every night and talk&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I&amp;rsquo;m going to give her a break and serve her and &lt;a title="Releasing Control" href="http://hedge-ops.com/releasing-control/">try to not control her&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Money&lt;/td>
&lt;td>If I get an extra job, I can pay off my debt and get an expensive car ten years from now&lt;/td>
&lt;td>I don&amp;rsquo;t need an expensive car. Or all this stuff. I&amp;rsquo;ll stop buying stuff and find that I have a lot of money left over that I can save. And wow, I&amp;rsquo;m happier!&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Sometimes the middle column is called for. But only temporarily, because discontentment leads to discontentment. It&amp;rsquo;s a neverending cycle. And the only way to get to where you want to go is through contentment. You may need to spend a few months moving the needle. Great. The focus though should be on finding contentment in your life, and creating a margin of time, money, and focus that will help you accomplish your goals long-term.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Move the Needle with Dave Ramsey</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/move-the-needle-with-dave-ramsey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 08:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/move-the-needle-with-dave-ramsey/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>We had &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-the-catalyst/">a failure that was the catalyst to change&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/you-need-a-budget/">a tool that would help us change our relationship with money&lt;/a>. Now we needed to get out of debt. We needed to get serious. We needed &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595555277/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1595555277&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=hedgeopscom-20&amp;amp;linkId=O5HAQUNJLACSUUTX">Dave Ramsey&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Full disclosure: our household has kind of moved away from some of Dave Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s ideas since 2010 when we drank the Koolaid. I&amp;rsquo;ll get into why in the next post, but for now I want to write what I appreciate about him and how he presented personal finance to us in a way that got us serious about getting out of debt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dave Ramsey doesn&amp;rsquo;t do debt. He hates it. To him, the only reason one should get into debt is to buy a house, and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t even fully recommend that one. Most people think he&amp;rsquo;s extreme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ramsey&amp;rsquo;s genius is that when it comes to being in debt, being extreme is exactly what is called for. The numbers aren&amp;rsquo;t the reason people aren&amp;rsquo;t getting out of debt; the psychology is. So when you get out debt the Dave Ramsey way, you sell everything. You don&amp;rsquo;t eat out. You think about it every day. You work extra. Maybe an extra job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You get sick and tired of being sick and tired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The principle here is &lt;em>Move the Needle&lt;/em>. Sometimes it makes sense to get crazy and move the needle in some area of your life. Make a change happen, possibly at the short-term sacrifice of other things, so you don&amp;rsquo;t quit. Once you accomplish something, quitting it is no longer an option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you&amp;rsquo;re needing to make a change and gut it out in the short term in order to create the environment where you can win in the long, term, have at it! I know with getting out of debt, this is the only way to go in order to actually do it. If you try to nickel and dime your way out of debt, you&amp;rsquo;ll never get there because you&amp;rsquo;ll get distracted and go after something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we got serious and decided to move the needle with getting out of debt, all the pieces fell into place and we got out of debt really quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is when this becomes a way of life. At some point, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to stop moving the needle. More on this in the next post.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
