&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.anniehedgie.com">My wife&lt;/a> and I spent the early part of this week looking into a business opportunity that would help us meet some specific goals over the next few years. We were excited, talking late into the night about the various details of this business opportunity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then halfway into our trip we realized &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/failure-masquerading-as-success/">it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, we could have made it work. We could have brought more into the deal and thus introduced more risk. We could have compromised our values or our goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was reminded me of &lt;a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2010/08/25/the-best-investment-advice-you-will-ever-get/">Mark Cuban&amp;rsquo;s advice&lt;/a>: get out of debt and save up 100K in cash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does he give this advice? Because if you have cash that you can invest, a right fit will come along and present itself. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go try to make things work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have to force anything. I can stay true to my values. And I should continue to live a simple and frugal lifestyle. If I do this, the right fit will come along.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Christmas with Russians</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2014 08:00:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It was Christmas 2008, and the world was going to end. We didn&amp;rsquo;t know if there would be an economy or even civilization. And I had two weeks of vacation to end the year. I had an 18 month old who was mostly occupying himself with Christmas toys, and my wife was two months away from having my second child. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to take the vacation, but the policy at the time was &amp;ldquo;use it or lose it&amp;rdquo;, so I took it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could have done anything with those two weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose to set up &lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continous Integration&lt;/a> for one of our largest products through &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/">TeamCity&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was something I was passionate about. I had &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026772IS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0026772IS&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=hedgeopscom-20&amp;amp;linkId=RJ6US3SXFLCWDTR5">read the literature&lt;/a> on how transformative Continuous Integration had been to organizations. This product was built twice a day by a homeade tool called bmcon.exe and some batch files. If the build broke, dozens of people stopped everything to try to get it working, with no clear feedback mechanism for knowing what went wrong, who did it, and whether it was being worked on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was my moral duty to fix this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it so happened that those working on TeamCity were going to take their Christmas holiday&amp;hellip;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_Russia">on January 7&lt;/a>. They were Russian. So I took it upon myself to monitor the email and get the build working over the Christmas holidays. I remember on Christmas day &lt;a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/TW-6471">I was conversing with&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://de.linkedin.com/in/jonnyzzz">Eugene Pentrenko&lt;/a> across the world about how to deal with the complexities of TFS pulling thousands of files and then building them*.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years later, almost all of our products build with TeamCity, and we have thousands of integration tests and tens of thousands unit tests that run on our 100+ build agents to make it happen. It is central to everything we do. And it all started one Christmas years ago when I had a &amp;ldquo;moral duty&amp;rdquo; to do something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the book &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KPM424/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B008KPM424&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=hedgeopscom-20&amp;amp;linkId=52YQPMBZ7Z4IMUKU">Selling with Noble Purpose&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;, &lt;a href="http://www.mcleodandmore.com/what-is-selling-with-noble-purpose/">Lisa McLeod&lt;/a> leads the reader through an exercise where the reader thinks about situations where one makes a difference with customers, in a different way than other people, while loving what they are doing. When I went through this exercise I was reminded of this story. Through the exercise I found my noble purpose:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I share tools and insight for success&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what truly excites me, and why this blog exists. I want to share the tools and insights I&amp;rsquo;ve found to succeed. I want to help those who have given me tools and insights that have made me more effective by spreading them to others. And I want to properly define success so I can make sure to follow the path that will lead me there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next few posts, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about key elements of &lt;em>true&lt;/em> success. Success is one of those things that seems easy to see in others, but never seems recognizable in ourselves. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a few reasons why this is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>_* You can&amp;rsquo;t see it in the issue I link to above but Eugene was emailing me and went above and beyond, after his normal hours, to resolve the issue._&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
