&lt;p>When I started &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">learning Chef&lt;/a> in earnest I realized quickly that my need to know what was happening was leading me to need to dive into a book on Ruby and figure out what all the magic I was seeing in Chef was really about. Chef has an amazing way of being usable for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know much Ruby, but I&amp;rsquo;m the curious type that just needs to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started out with &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/13QZz1v">The Ruby Programming Language&lt;/a> but found it to be too much of a reference work that basically stated facts about the language instead of walking the reader through the learning process. I was delighted to find &lt;a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby&lt;/a> to be exactly that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was able to get through the book in a few days. It starts you out with objects, which for Ruby is the right place to start out. As I&amp;rsquo;m teaching my son how to program, the concept of objects is very easy for him to pick up. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to start with primitives, then control flow, then objects for people to learn. Learning is less logically structured than that. People don&amp;rsquo;t think like computers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each chapter in the book is about fifteen to twenty minutes of time investment and walks you through an example that you can easily code on your own. I find that when learning these things, I can&amp;rsquo;t just read it and know it. I need to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> something as well. This book did a great job at keeping me engaged with my ruby interpreter as well as with my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In November I set a goal to be working with Ruby every day by February. This book did a great job at making the goal possible. It demystified how Chef was doing its magic, but it has done so much more. It has opened me up to a whole new world of possibilities by quickly being able to script a solution to a problem without having to go through all the hoops of a statically typed programming language. While I still love C# and will use it for certain problems, Ruby is not a part of my life, thanks partly to this excellent book.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
