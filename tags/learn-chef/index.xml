&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Continuous Delivery sounds wonderful when &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/jez-humble-lean-enterprise">you&amp;rsquo;re at a conference&lt;/a>. You hear about companies like &lt;a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-continuous-delivery">Netflix&lt;/a> that deploy to production many times per day. When &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">learning Chef&lt;/a>, people often ask me if we really need something that will enable us to deploy that often. Some of them are on projects that take many months to deliver, and the customer would have it no other way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I answer this problem by splitting it up into two questions:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How quickly does a customer want a Severity 1 defect fixed in production?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d say the answer to this is usually, regardless of the tooling used, within a few hours. If there is a critical defect affecting operations, no one is talking about how we&amp;rsquo;ll have that delivered in a few months. People are on phones, developers are doing what it takes to get done, and something happens. So I&amp;rsquo;d say in this situation it&amp;rsquo;s a great investment to automate your delivery so the emergency situation is as tested as the non emergency situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How quickly does a customer want a feature in production?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a trickier question. We can separate the answer into what the customer &lt;em>wants&lt;/em> and what the customer &lt;em>expects&lt;/em>. The customer &lt;em>wants&lt;/em> to have the feature in production right now. Otherwise they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have told you about it. I have never heard a user make a request for change in software and say, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just letting you know, I&amp;rsquo;d rather have it six months from now.&amp;rdquo; Now is always better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, our customers have a business to run, so they&amp;rsquo;re not going to be foolish with updates. They want us to &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/safety-net/">fully test and properly deliver the software&lt;/a>. So I believe their answer to this question would be: &lt;strong>as quickly as you can safely get it to me.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a flexible arrangement based on the trust we create from automating our delivery and testing process. The better job we do, the more they trust us and the quicker they get their software. It will probably never be _today_that they get updates, but also if we&amp;rsquo;re taking this seriously it also shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So even for us, with real customers that are paying us to get it right, there is room for continuous delivery and Chef.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Phoenix Project Book Review</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/the-phoenix-project-book-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2015 08:00:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/the-phoenix-project-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;ve looked into devops more and more over the past few months, the book &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1AinIdB">The Phoenix Project&lt;/a> has come up over and over. I finally bought it when Matt Stratton at chef basically insisted on it in &lt;a href="http://www.mattstratton.com/tech/devops">his very awesome reading list&lt;/a> to ramp yourself up on devops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been into fiction very much, but over the summer I read &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1zx9aT7">A Man in Full&lt;/a> as a means of integrating stoicism into my own philosophy. That book lit up my imagination and helped me absorb the stoic themes in a way that would be difficult had I just read an outline of stoicism. I was awakened to the reality of how fiction can transform your mind deeply by awakening all aspects of the mind during learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I was very excited to read the book. And the book did not disappoint in changing my outlook on my own career and what is possible for those around me. It taught me a few basic lessons that I believe will transform my behavior in the future:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Have a respect for the system.&lt;/strong> Up until I read this book I treated a inefficient system like it was garbage. Let&amp;rsquo;s get rid of the inefficiency! This is dumb! What I realized by reading the book is that in order for you to effectively and profitably change a system, you must have a respect and understanding of why it is the way it is. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know why it is this way, you can realize that it is an inefficient system, but you will not effectively change it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/measure-for-reality/">Measure, Measure, Measure&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong> The main character in the book has a great respect for measurement. People say you can&amp;rsquo;t manage what you don&amp;rsquo;t measure. I think that can be taken too far, but there is a reality in it: if I can&amp;rsquo;t measure the reality of the system, it will be very difficult for me to (1) convince people that a more efficient change is needed, and (2) know that the changes I am making are having their desired effect.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Take a Breath and Count to 2.&lt;/strong> One of the nice things about the book that taught me a lesson is when the main character interacts with various antagonists, who are obviously being reckless, dumb, and incendiary, the main character will take a breath and count to 2. Then respond. And when he responds, it&amp;rsquo;s with facts and an attitude of doing what&amp;rsquo;s best for everyone. I desperately want to exhibit this kind of tact and patience. I get so passionate about my ideas that I can forget to have patience, be calm, and move the ball forward.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Find the Bottleneck Constraint.&lt;/strong> In the book there is a legendary character named Brent. Brent can do everything. He can fix problems in seconds that everyone has spent days trying to understand. He knows why this server is the way it is, and the answer lies in activities from 2002. Brent has everyone asking him for everything and the business is at it&amp;rsquo;s knees due to Brent&amp;rsquo;s inability to clone himself into fifty other people. In the book, the main focus was on getting Brent isolated and his work properly documented, prioritized, and managed. Brent remained a hugely valuable member of the team, but they couldn&amp;rsquo;t grow until his workload was under control. And once Brent had his priorities under control, he was able to do some special things for the company.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I really enjoyed the Phoenix Project and recommend it to anyone wanting to lead change in their organization using lean principles. It reaches the reader in a way that a nonfiction book can&amp;rsquo;t: you can feel the tension. You drop the F-bombs right there with the reader. You feel the desperation as the core concepts come to life. And therefore when you face similar situations, you have a whole new world of awesome manufacturing theory available to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book was one of the best software-related books I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. If you want to be a leader, please get a copy and read it. Then invite me to lunch and let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it; maybe we can change the world together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Programming Ruby (Pickaxe) Book Review</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/programming-ruby-pickaxe-book-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2015 08:00:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/programming-ruby-pickaxe-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When I started &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">learning Chef&lt;/a> in earnest I realized quickly that my need to know what was happening was leading me to need to dive into a book on Ruby and figure out what all the magic I was seeing in Chef was really about. Chef has an amazing way of being usable for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know much Ruby, but I&amp;rsquo;m the curious type that just needs to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started out with &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/13QZz1v">The Ruby Programming Language&lt;/a> but found it to be too much of a reference work that basically stated facts about the language instead of walking the reader through the learning process. I was delighted to find &lt;a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby&lt;/a> to be exactly that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was able to get through the book in a few days. It starts you out with objects, which for Ruby is the right place to start out. As I&amp;rsquo;m teaching my son how to program, the concept of objects is very easy for him to pick up. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to start with primitives, then control flow, then objects for people to learn. Learning is less logically structured than that. People don&amp;rsquo;t think like computers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each chapter in the book is about fifteen to twenty minutes of time investment and walks you through an example that you can easily code on your own. I find that when learning these things, I can&amp;rsquo;t just read it and know it. I need to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> something as well. This book did a great job at keeping me engaged with my ruby interpreter as well as with my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In November I set a goal to be working with Ruby every day by February. This book did a great job at making the goal possible. It demystified how Chef was doing its magic, but it has done so much more. It has opened me up to a whole new world of possibilities by quickly being able to script a solution to a problem without having to go through all the hoops of a statically typed programming language. While I still love C# and will use it for certain problems, Ruby is not a part of my life, thanks partly to this excellent book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Customizing Chef Book Review</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/customizing-chef-book-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2015 08:00:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/customizing-chef-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-customizing-chef-book-review.jpg" alt="Customizing Chef" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When I was stuck trying to understand simple concepts about Chef, I bought two books: &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1wHMEZb">Learning Chef&lt;/a> (read the review) and &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1Ajtt8G">Customizing Chef&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="http://jonliv.es/">Jon Cowie&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning Chef gave me the basic concepts, but Customizing Chef gave me the deep understanding I needed to evaluate the tool for my large, complicated organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the closed-source Microsoft world, you figure out what the thing can do and just accept it. The book opened my eyes that Chef allows me to use a skill (reading code) that I&amp;rsquo;ve built up for over ten years. This leads to a much deeper understanding of how it works than just &amp;ldquo;trust us this feature does X&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s not the best thing about the book though. The thing I appreciated the most was the ability to learn from the author who implemented a world class deployment solution for &lt;a href="https://codeascraft.com/">Etsy&lt;/a> using chef. The examples he provided were real world. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a textbook exposition on chef. You could tell that this was the real deal. Learning from him in this way reinforced the idea that chef was something I could implement in my complicated organization and that with every problem that arises I have options because of chef&amp;rsquo;s extensibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author did a wonderful job at explaining that extensibility with examples at every level. I learned how to customize chef&amp;rsquo;s notification customizations, cookbooks, and even knife itself. Every explanation of a customization didn&amp;rsquo;t merely explain it; it started with the code and took the reader through a series of examples to build up understanding of the customization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Customizing Chef isn&amp;rsquo;t for someone who is just starting chef. For that I would recommend the tutorials or the book Learning Chef. For someone who is tasked with implementing it in a complicated organization or someone who has been using it for months and has come across some scaling challenges, this book is a life-saver.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning Chef Book Review</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 08:00:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">
&lt;img src="https://hedge-ops.com/images/feature-learning-chef-book-review.jpg" alt="Learning Chef Book Review" />
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A couple of months ago I found myself drowning in the learning curve that was &lt;a href="http://chef.io">chef&lt;/a>. I had great support from them, but I&amp;rsquo;m the type of person who needs to know a technology in order to appropriately evaluate it. I could tell that chef was a nice technology, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went through &lt;a href="https://learn.chef.io/">the tutorials&lt;/a> but they weren&amp;rsquo;t adequate for me to understand the solution. Then I found the book &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1Ajqayd">Learning Chef&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning Chef is an excellent first step in understanding the chef universe in order to get started on the right foot with the tool. I absolutely loved the tutorial, incremental approach that &lt;a href="http://misheska.com/">the&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://sethvargo.com/">authors&lt;/a> take to go from running a recipe on your own machine to running tests on locally available virtual machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which leads me to my other pleasant surprise of this book: it lays out the techniques you can use with chef in order to test what you&amp;rsquo;re doing so you know that it works. That is what separates chef from many other solutions I&amp;rsquo;ve seen: &lt;a href="http://kitchen.ci/">they bake testing into the process itself&lt;/a>. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to treat infrastructure as code then you &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to test it as a part of your deployment pipeline. Fortunately this introductory book doesn&amp;rsquo;t skimp on this core aspect of chef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third great thing about this book is that it is very approachable to those of us who have built their careers programming in the Windows environment. Every command has a hint at what you would do on a windows box. This really increased my comfort level with learning chef by allowing me to learn it in &lt;em>my own&lt;/em> development environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book is not for people who want a quick, few hour understanding of chef to get up and running. For example if I bring a new team on board with Chef, I probably won&amp;rsquo;t hand them this book; I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a couple of day class with them to teach them the basics. If they&amp;rsquo;re the type of person (like me) who wants to dig deeper though and learns by doing, this book is a fabulous step in becoming proficient at using chef.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
