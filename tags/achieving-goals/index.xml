&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re doing great here, and you&amp;rsquo;re an asset to what we&amp;rsquo;re doing. We think you have a bright future with us.&amp;rdquo; My boss was obviously happy &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/">with my performance&lt;/a> and was telling me about it in no uncertain terms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s great, and I appreciate it, but when will I get promoted to Software Architect?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted more than anything at that point in my career to be a &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/2010/snapshots/1.html">Software Architect&lt;/a>. The title comes with respect, a great salary, and a leadership position within a software development organization. Most people who knew my goal never questioned its efficacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>…But I now see that it was the wrong goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A good goal is one that delivers what it promises: contentment and happiness.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contentment I envisioned after getting the promotion very quickly became discontentment wrapped around another, bigger goal. All of the sudden I wanted to be a Senior Software Architect. And then more. And more. This is insanity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a better way: goals that lead to contentment. Some examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>You&amp;rsquo;ll never be content with having&lt;/th>
&lt;th>But you will be content with&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>The next promotion&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Doing work that matters and being fairly rewarded for it&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>A big raise&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Spending less than you make, whatever it is&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>A new luxury car&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A car you can afford&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>The spouse of your dreams&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A marriage based on love, acceptance, and peace&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>In the left column, everything seems so deceptively simple. &amp;ldquo;All I want is a Mercedes.&amp;rdquo; Well, yes, but _what happens when you get the Mercedes? What &lt;strong>then?&lt;/strong> The left side is one in which you never end up at a destination. You are always striving, always anxious, always gunning for the next thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The left column is a series of steps in life that all follow a commonly accepted pattern of &amp;ldquo;going for the next thing&amp;rdquo;, but arriving nowhere important. These goals ultimately lead to misery and despair once one inevitably finds this out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s strange is that no one questions this path to success, even though there are so many examples of burned out, depressed, unhappy people who have followed it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A better definition of success is on the right side. These are achievable goals, not in a few years but right now. The goals aren&amp;rsquo;t as measurable, and those around you won&amp;rsquo;t notice them as much as they would a new Mercedes. However, they deliver what they promise: achievable contentment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Success is achievable contentment through goals that have an end to them. The end of a truly success-oriented goal isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>another goal.&lt;/em> It is contentment and peace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are your goals? Where will they lead?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
