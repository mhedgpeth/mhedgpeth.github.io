&lt;p>When I started &lt;a href="https://hedge-ops.com/learning-chef-book-review/">learning Chef&lt;/a> in earnest I realized quickly that my need to know what was happening was leading me to need to dive into a book on Ruby and figure out what all the magic I was seeing in Chef was really about. Chef has an amazing way of being usable for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know much Ruby, but I&amp;rsquo;m the curious type that just needs to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started out with &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/13QZz1v">The Ruby Programming Language&lt;/a> but found it to be too much of a reference work that basically stated facts about the language instead of walking the reader through the learning process. I was delighted to find &lt;a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby&lt;/a> to be exactly that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was able to get through the book in a few days. It starts you out with objects, which for Ruby is the right place to start out. As I&amp;rsquo;m teaching my son how to program, the concept of objects is very easy for him to pick up. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to start with primitives, then control flow, then objects for people to learn. Learning is less logically structured than that. People don&amp;rsquo;t think like computers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each chapter in the book is about fifteen to twenty minutes of time investment and walks you through an example that you can easily code on your own. I find that when learning these things, I can&amp;rsquo;t just read it and know it. I need to &lt;em>do&lt;/em> something as well. This book did a great job at keeping me engaged with my ruby interpreter as well as with my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In November I set a goal to be working with Ruby every day by February. This book did a great job at making the goal possible. It demystified how Chef was doing its magic, but it has done so much more. It has opened me up to a whole new world of possibilities by quickly being able to script a solution to a problem without having to go through all the hoops of a statically typed programming language. While I still love C# and will use it for certain problems, Ruby is not a part of my life, thanks partly to this excellent book.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Customizing Chef Book Review</title><link>https://hedge-ops.com/customizing-chef-book-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2015 08:00:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hedge-ops.com/customizing-chef-book-review/</guid><description>&lt;div class="full-width">

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When I was stuck trying to understand simple concepts about Chef, I bought two books: &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1wHMEZb">Learning Chef&lt;/a> (read the review) and &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1Ajtt8G">Customizing Chef&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="http://jonliv.es/">Jon Cowie&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning Chef gave me the basic concepts, but Customizing Chef gave me the deep understanding I needed to evaluate the tool for my large, complicated organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the closed-source Microsoft world, you figure out what the thing can do and just accept it. The book opened my eyes that Chef allows me to use a skill (reading code) that I&amp;rsquo;ve built up for over ten years. This leads to a much deeper understanding of how it works than just &amp;ldquo;trust us this feature does X&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s not the best thing about the book though. The thing I appreciated the most was the ability to learn from the author who implemented a world class deployment solution for &lt;a href="https://codeascraft.com/">Etsy&lt;/a> using chef. The examples he provided were real world. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a textbook exposition on chef. You could tell that this was the real deal. Learning from him in this way reinforced the idea that chef was something I could implement in my complicated organization and that with every problem that arises I have options because of chef&amp;rsquo;s extensibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The author did a wonderful job at explaining that extensibility with examples at every level. I learned how to customize chef&amp;rsquo;s notification customizations, cookbooks, and even knife itself. Every explanation of a customization didn&amp;rsquo;t merely explain it; it started with the code and took the reader through a series of examples to build up understanding of the customization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Customizing Chef isn&amp;rsquo;t for someone who is just starting chef. For that I would recommend the tutorials or the book Learning Chef. For someone who is tasked with implementing it in a complicated organization or someone who has been using it for months and has come across some scaling challenges, this book is a life-saver.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
