&lt;/div>
&lt;p>A couple of months ago I found myself drowning in the learning curve that was &lt;a href="http://chef.io">chef&lt;/a>. I had great support from them, but I&amp;rsquo;m the type of person who needs to know a technology in order to appropriately evaluate it. I could tell that chef was a nice technology, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went through &lt;a href="https://learn.chef.io/">the tutorials&lt;/a> but they weren&amp;rsquo;t adequate for me to understand the solution. Then I found the book &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/1Ajqayd">Learning Chef&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning Chef is an excellent first step in understanding the chef universe in order to get started on the right foot with the tool. I absolutely loved the tutorial, incremental approach that &lt;a href="http://misheska.com/">the&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://sethvargo.com/">authors&lt;/a> take to go from running a recipe on your own machine to running tests on locally available virtual machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which leads me to my other pleasant surprise of this book: it lays out the techniques you can use with chef in order to test what you&amp;rsquo;re doing so you know that it works. That is what separates chef from many other solutions I&amp;rsquo;ve seen: &lt;a href="http://kitchen.ci/">they bake testing into the process itself&lt;/a>. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to treat infrastructure as code then you &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to test it as a part of your deployment pipeline. Fortunately this introductory book doesn&amp;rsquo;t skimp on this core aspect of chef.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third great thing about this book is that it is very approachable to those of us who have built their careers programming in the Windows environment. Every command has a hint at what you would do on a windows box. This really increased my comfort level with learning chef by allowing me to learn it in &lt;em>my own&lt;/em> development environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book is not for people who want a quick, few hour understanding of chef to get up and running. For example if I bring a new team on board with Chef, I probably won&amp;rsquo;t hand them this book; I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do a couple of day class with them to teach them the basics. If they&amp;rsquo;re the type of person (like me) who wants to dig deeper though and learns by doing, this book is a fabulous step in becoming proficient at using chef.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
