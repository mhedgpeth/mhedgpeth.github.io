Over the past year I've grown to see [the absolute insanity](/escaping-with-the-news/) of following the news on normal news sites like CNN or Fox News. You might be thinking that I have no clue what is going on in the world. I do value being an educated person who knows about world events.

I have a secret weapon that helps me get this insight into the world without driving myself crazy day to day. <!--more-->It's [a paper subscription](http://www.subscriptionaddiction.com/magazines/subscription/the-economist-magazine-magazine.jsp) to [The Economist magazine](http://www.economist.com/). Here are seven things I love about having a paper subscription to The Economist:

  1. **International.** It's not focused on Americans only. I get more of an insight into the world than the typical American news outlets.
  2. **Soap Opera Free.** It doesn't try to get me sucked into idiotic stories about how people are going to react to this or that, or worse what a celebrity was doing last Friday night. I want to be an educated man who knows world events…not a celebrity gossip connoisseur. The subscription keeps everything serious and leaves the rest out.
  3. **Distraction Free.** When I read the magazine, I don't see emails popping up. My kids don't think I'm playing video games. They know I'm reading a serious news magazine. And when I put it down, I do something else. I don't get sucked into ten hours of mindless video watching. **This is a feature and not a bug.**
  4. **Not Republican or Democrat.** I love it that I get out of the false American dichotomy of Republican and Democrat with the magazine. It has no interest in getting me to be _more_ one way or another. It just calls it like it sees it. Which is probably more of a Libertarian bent but honestly it's difficult to tell sometimes. And that's how I would like to take my news. I don't want to be told what to think. I want some facts and fair analysis and I want to think about it myself.
  5. **Weekly.** I don't think that the appropriate news cadence should be any more frequent than once a week. If something is important I'm going to find out about it. I don't need to spend every day reading the news. It just doesn't matter that much. So the fact that the Economist is weekly is perfect for me.
  6. **Guilt Free to Skip.** This isn't a "feature" of the magazine as much as it is for me. If I had a weekly subscription and didn't read _any_ of it, I still think it would be worth it. Why? Because it kept me from the hours per day of distraction I had been getting by going to news sites. So the Economist can be skipped just fine.
  7. **Diversified.** It's not just a political magazine. It also has stuff on business, technology, science. It has special features that bring you up to speed on a topic in depth.

I have subscribed to the Economist for months now and absolutely love it. I highly recommend you ditch your current news habit and buy an Economist subscription. I did some searching and found a deeply discounted deal [here](http://www.subscriptionaddiction.com/magazines/subscription/the-economist-magazine-magazine.jsp). Try it and you'll be hooked. If you run into me personally, I'll be happy to give you a copy so you can see what I'm saying; just ask.
