We've all been there.

Bumper to bumper traffic. Lights ahead. An ambulance speeds by in the shoulder lane.

We inch by for a few minutes, and finally make it to the accident. Then something inevitable happens:<!--more-->

_OMG what happened!?!?! I need to brake and see what happened! Are they going to be OK? Do I know them? Is there...BLOOD?_

Rubbernecking.

This is exactly what is happening in the local news. I'd like to give you a test to take right now:

  1. Go to your [local news site](http://www.wfaa.com).
  2. Count how many articles that fulfill this criteria: 
      1. You will remember them a month from now
      2. You didn't hear about them from another source
      3. They will affect your life in some way

I just did this as of this writing, on September 5. I counted zero articles. I think that you might come up with a similar amount.

What's going on here?

**We like knowing that no matter how bad things are for us, or how crappy our day is, there are at least a few people on the news that have it worse.**

What value does this serve us? Logically speaking, absolutely none. This is a worthless activity. It isn't even [entertaining like sports](/sports-news-soap-operas-for-people-who-make-fun-of-soap-operas/). It has no significance in the lifes and livelihood of all but a very small number of people.

So I'm trying to wean myself off of my local news addiction. I'm not replacing it with anything. I'm just stopping. I've had varying degrees of success over the past few months, because I love reading the local news.

It's worthless.

I hope to fully believe that one day.
