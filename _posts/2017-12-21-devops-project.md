I was at lunch with my friend [Megan Bohl](https://twitter.com/MeganBohl) who is a fellow [DevOps Days Organizer](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-dallas/), and is taking a DevOps course with [Tech Talent South](https://www.techtalentsouth.com/). Megan is finishing her course in a few weeks and is ready to go find a DevOps job. However, like many people learning about this stuff for the first time, Megan wants to bring everything together into a nice project.

Before lunch, I spoke with Megan and her class about how it's necessary to know the context and problems that different technologies address in order to properly understand and properly be prepared for a DevOps Engineering position. So with that in mind, I'll propose a project that Megan and anyone can do to get a basic feel for what DevOps is all about. Hopefully this can be used by a lot of people to get their feet wet with DevOps automation tools.

If you want to follow along in the project, please do it in order. Don't skip any steps. And if you get to a point where you're thinking "I don't know anything about git!" or whatever, have no fear. Stop, spend some time on learning git, and then keep going. You can do this project without any previous technology experience, assuming you have someone helping you look in the right places. And that's the final thing: use this as a guide to get you on your way but find a technical friend to sponsor your learning and interact with you. That will be huge.

We'll deliver the project in phases:

# Phase 1: Simple Website

1. Create an account on [https://github.com/](GitHub) 
2. Create a repository named `website` on GitHub
3. Clone your `website` repository locally using your terminal (`Terminal` on a mac or `PowerShell` on windows). 
4. Create a branch called `feature_index`
5. Add an `index.html` to the branch that says `Hello, World!` in the text. You'll want to make the change with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
6. Check that in 
7. Create a pull request for your branch to be merged into `master` and assign the pull request to your mentor. If you don't have a mentor, assign it to me, `mhedgpeth`! :)
8. Merge your pull request into `master` after it's approved

## What We're Learning

In order to work well with DevOps automation and tooling, you need to know the basics about source control and editing code. This gives you that foundation. It also gives us something to deploy in future phases.

## Resources for Phase 1

* [Try Git in 15 minutes](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
* [Getting Started with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
* [Codecademy Learn HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

# Phase 2: Simple Webserver

Now that you have a website, you want to now create a webserver. This is a machine that will provide other machines the contents of your `index.html` file from phase 1. This machine will be a linux machine hosted on [Microsoft Azure Cloud](https://portal.azure.com) with [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) running on it.

1. Create an account on Azure and activate your [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/)
2. Create an ubuntu virtual machine on Azure
3. SSH to that machine. If you're on windows use [Matt Wrock's guide](http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/need-an-ssh-client-on-windows-dont-use-putty-or-cygwinuse-git) to getting a ssh client.
4. [Set up nginx on the machine](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=set+up+nginx+on+ubuntu)
5. Clone your git repository to `/var/www/html` on the server
6. Using the public ip assigned to your ubuntu server, access the website (i.e. `http://[your-ip]`). Your website should show up.
7. Have a friend on another computer do this. They should see the website too. Magical!

## What We're Learning

My friend Nathan Harvey has said to me that you can't automate that which you do not understand. If you're going to "do the DevOps" but can't do it manually, then you're going too fast! So we're learning the basics here of setting up a machine.

## Resources for Phase 2

* [Setting Up Linux Virtual Machine on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal)
* [Nginx Tutorial](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/nginx/index.html)
* [Nano Tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/) for editing text files in an ssh session

# Phase 3: Deploy a Change

Now it's time to deploy a change! Let's do this the old fashioned way the first time around.

1. Create a new branch on your repository named `feature_myname`.
2. Update `index.html` to say "Hello, Michael!"
3. Create a pull request, get it reviewed, and merge it
4. On your webserver, update your `index.html` file from GitHub.
5. Get on twitter and send me a message @michaelhedgpeth with a link. Show me that I didn't waste my time! :)

## What We're Learning

This is how a majority of people have deployed things for a long time. The manual way. You can't realize what problems different tools solve before you do it manually. I'm purposely not giving you the exact steps to follow because I want you to find those steps on your own or with a mentor. Google it! This is how you learn.

# Phase 4: Create a Chef Cookbook to Automate Machine Setup

Now think about what your life would be like if you had to do the above steps thousands of times on hundreds of servers. Your life would not be fun, and in addition to that you would have hundreds of servers that were all a little bit different because, over time, you weren't consistent. This is why you use something like Chef.

This is a big technical jump from the previous phases. Take your time here. If you've never done this stuff you might spend a couple of weeks on it. You'll have questions. Get on the [Chef Community Slack](http://chefcommunity.slack.com) and post them on the #general channel. Don't be afraid; we all were here and support you!

1. On GitHub create a repository called `my_website`.
2. Clone that repository locally and switch to a branch called `feature_nginx`
3. Set up `nginx` using the [package](https://docs.chef.io/resource_package.html) resource
4. Use [Test Kitchen](https://kitchen.ci/) to make sure your cookbook installs the package. Use kitchen with a [Policyfile](/policyfiles/). There will be a `Policyfile.rb` in the cookbook that defines your run list if you're doing this right.
5. Write an [Inspec Test](http://www.anniehedgie.com/inspec/) that ensures the package is installed
6. Create a PR and get it merged
7. Create another branch called `feature_website`
8. Using the [git resource](https://docs.chef.io/resource_git.html) clone your repository on GitHub
9. Write another inspec test to make sure that the website is served when you go to `http://localhost` and that the contents contain "Hello, Michael!"
10. Make sure that `kitchen test` works
11. Create a Pull Request and Merge into master

## Resources for Phase 4

* [Learn Chef Rally](https://learn.chef.io/#/). If you're new to Chef, spend a lot of time here. Like days. Get through the basics and what I write above will make a lot more sense
* [My Policyfiles Post](/policyfiles/). My description of that feature. Do yourself a favor and use it. It will simplify your life.
* [Annie's InSpec Tutorials](http://www.anniehedgie.com/inspec/). Still the best place on the internet to learn InSpec.

# Phase 5: Deploy Your Chef Cookbook to Azure

Now it's time to use your Chef Cookbook as a way to not have to manually deploy and update your machine. After you do this step, you'll be able to consistently create as many machines as you want, with very little effort!

1. Create a new virtual machine on Azure using the portal
2. Create an account and organization on [manage.chef.io](http://manage.chef.io). If you did the learn chef rally above, you should already have this set up.
3. Push your cookbook policy to the chef server (see my [blog post](/policyfiles/) for the exact command.
4. [Bootstrap your node](https://docs.chef.io/install_bootstrap.html) with the chef server. This will run the policy on that node, setting up nginx and everything!
5. Hit the public IP associated with the node and see that it serves your website perfectly! Magic!
6. Now deploy a new change to your website and call it "Hello, Automated World!". Tell me about it (@michaelhedgpeth on twitter). I'll give you a high five for getting this far!

## What We're Learning

Hopefully you see the benefits of automating the setup of the machine. From now on, everything is consistent and just works. Your drama for making changes goes down. And you can do this as many times as it's called for!

# Phase 6: Automate Creation of VMs in Azure with Terraform

Now that we have a Virtual Machine that we can easily set up, you might be tempted to quit. But there's something lingering there: even though you automated what was _inside_ of the virtual machine, you still have to manually set up the machine itself. This is easy enough when you have one machine, but what if you have hundreds? That's where Terraform comes in:

1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `website_provision`
1. In that repo, create a terraform script that creates a virtual machine within a network with an external ip address
2. Make your terraform script bootstrap the VM with your Chef Server and assign it to your policy
3. Wath with awe how terraform allows you to create and destroy your _entire_ stack, all the way from the machines itself to what's on the machines (with Chef).

## What We're Learning

The environment within which your application runs is one of the most complicated aspecs of the application. Thus, you should invest in automating that and keeping yourself away from the user interface. Terraform is a great tool for this.

## Phase 6 Resources

* [Terraform Resources](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html)
* [Azure Terraform Provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/)
* [Azure Terraform Examples](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/master/examples)

# Phase 7: Workflow Automation with Jenkins

Now that we have an automated process that will deploy our stuff, we want to make our workflow easy to execute with Jenkins. Before you move on I highly recommend Wes Higbee's [Jenkins class on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jenkins-2-getting-started). It's well worth the trouble. That will give you the context you need to go through these steps:

1. Create a rakefile for your `my_website` cookbook using [my blog post])(http://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-development-with-rakefile/) as a guide.
2. Create a `Jenkinsfile` for your cookbook using [my blog post](http://hedge-ops.com/cookbook-pipeline-with-jenkinsfile/) as a guide
3. Create a Jenkins server. If you took the class you may already have one.
4. Create a Jenkins build for `my_website` that runs on all branches (using the multi-branch pipeline, as Wes explains in the course)
5. Create a branch called `broken` and add code that will break your cookbook
6. Check it into the branch, and watch Jenkins tell you it's broken! 

## What We're Learning

We're automatically providing the accountability people need to know that their software still works. It's better to learn that _as_ you're making the changes rather than when they get to production. So Jenkins helps us see how, when we change software over time, that software still meets our expectations. It reinforces the best practices for your team: you should run test kitchen before checking in changes. The safety imposed by Jenkins will keep you on the straight and narrow path!

## Resources for Learning

* [Getting Started with Jenkins 2](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/jenkins-2-getting-started)

# Extra Credit

I think if you do the above project, you'll be well on your way to getting things working. Here are some other ideas, for extra credit:

* With [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) store a secret and have your chef cookbook (using the vault gem) read the secret and write it to your web page
* Create a Jenkins pipeline that will deploy your terraform templates
* Instead of using Chef, use Docker (perhaps with Habitat) to deploy your application

# Conclusion

Hopefully this project will give you the context to know the basics of automating infrastructure. With this basis under your belt, you'll be able to make great progress in whatever situation you find yourself.
